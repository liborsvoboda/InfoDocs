# Open XML SDK

The [Open XML SDK](https://github.com/officedev/open-xml-sdk) provides .NET developers with a set of strongly typed classes that make it easy to read, write and manipulate the parts and content in an Open XML document such as the DOCX, XLSX or PPTX files created by Microsoft Office. It can be used in any .NET solution, and work is underway to enable use of it from Mono as well.
