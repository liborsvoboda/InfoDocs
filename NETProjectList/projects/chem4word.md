# Chemistry Add-in for Word

[Chem4Word](http://www.chem4word.co.uk/) enables you to create chemical structures directly in 
Microsoft Word.  Not only can you draw your own structures, but you can import structures from 
PubChem and Opsin as well as from your own files.  With the latest version, inside the editor 
form, you can export or import your structures as CML or MDL Molfile format. 
This will allow you to copy your edited structures to other documents or share them with 
other users or applications.
