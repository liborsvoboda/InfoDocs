# Build a Random Quote Machine

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/ONjoLe/.

## Requirements

* User Story: I can click a button to show me a new random quote.

* User Story: I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

## Notes

I have used:

* Bootstrap and CSS Flexbox for layout.

* Fontawesome for icons.

* Background from [here](http://www.heropatterns.com/).

* jQuery for Javascript code

## View Project
