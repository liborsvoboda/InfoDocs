  </blockquote>
      <p>In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation by the year 2020:</p>
      <blockquote><em>"I have identified five areas where India has a core competence for integrated action: 
        <ol>
          <li>Agriculture and food processing</li>
          <li>Education and healthcare</li>
          <li>Information and communication technology</li>
          <li>Infrastructure, reliable and quality electric power, surface transport and infrastructure for all parts of the country</li>
          <li>Self-reliance in critical technologies.</li></ol> These five areas are closely inter-related and if advanced in a coordinated way, will lead to food, economic and national security."</em></blockquote>
