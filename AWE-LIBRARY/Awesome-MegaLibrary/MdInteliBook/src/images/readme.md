# Images

Below are the credits for the images used to create the Awesome Roslyn logo, as well as the tools that helped create it.

## Awesome
The *awesome.svg* is based on the logo of the [Curated list of awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). The original image has been adapted in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), a professional vector graphics editor for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Inkscape is free and open source.

## Roslyn
The *roslyn.png* has been taken from [this MSDN Blogs page](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/secdevblog/tag/roslyn/).

## Awesome Roslyn Logo
The *awesome-roslyn-logo.svg* is as well created in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) by combining the *awesome.svg* and *roslyn.png*. The PNG version has been created by using the Inkscape's Export to PNG feature.
