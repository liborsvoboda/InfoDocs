Low Level Struct Improvements
=====

## Summary
This proposal is an aggregation of several different proposals for `struct` performance improvements: `ref` fields and the ability to override lifetime defaults. The goal being a design which takes into account the various proposals to create a single overarching feature set for low level `struct` improvements.

## Motivation
Earlier versions of C# added a number of low level performance features to the language: `ref` returns, `ref struct`, function pointers, etc. ... These enabled .NET developers to create write highly performant code while continuing to leverage the C# language rules for type and memory safety.  It also allowed the creation of fundamental performance types in the .NET libraries like `Span<T>`.

As these features have gained traction in the .NET ecosystem developers, both internal and external, have been providing us with information on remaining friction points in the ecosystem. Places where they still need to drop to `unsafe` code to get their work done, or require the runtime to special case types like `Span<T>`. 

Today `Span<T>` is accomplished by using the `internal` type `ByReference<T>` which the runtime effectively treats as a `ref` field. This provides the benefit of `ref` fields but with the downside that the language provides no safety verification for it, as it does for other uses of `ref`. Further only dotnet/runtime can use this type as it's `internal`, so 3rd parties can not design their own primitives based on `ref` fields. Part of the [motivation for this work](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/32060) is to remove `ByReference<T>` and use proper `ref` fields in all code bases. 

This proposal plans to address these issues by building on top of our existing low level features. Specifically it aims to:

- Allow `ref struct` types to declare `ref` fields.
- Allow the runtime to fully define `Span<T>` using the C# type system and remove special case type like `ByReference<T>`
- Allow `struct` types to return `ref` to their fields.
- Allow runtime to remove `unsafe` uses caused by limitations of lifetime defaults
- Allow the declaration of safe `fixed` buffers for managed and unmanaged types in `struct`

## Compat Considerations
The biggest challenge in the proposals presented here is they must be compatible with our existing [span safety rules](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-7.2/span-safety.md). That is the language can't introduce new lifetime safety errors for existing code patterns and that presents a challenge with several of the proposed features. It's important to understand these challenges as they significantly impact the design of the features.

To understand the challenges here let's first consider how `Span<T>` will look once `ref` fields are supported.

<a name="new-span"></a>

```c#
readonly ref struct Span<T>
{
    readonly ref T _field;
    int _length;

    // This constructor does not exist today but will be added as a part 
    // of changing Span<T> to have ref fields. It is a convenient, and
    // safe, way to create a length one span over a stack value that today 
    // requires unsafe code.
    [RefFieldEscapes]
    public Span(ref T value)
    {
        _field = ref value;
        _length = 1;
    }
}
```

The first challenge is the span safety rules make a [hard assumption](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/csharp-7.2/span-safety.md#span-constructor) that `Span<T>` has no such constructor. By extension this also introduced a hard assumption that `ref` fields do not exist. This resulted in a significant simplification of the rules but it allows for a number of patterns that make introducing `ref` fields significantly more difficult. 

Consider the following method signature:

```c#
Span<T> CreateSpan<T>(ref T parameter)
{
    // The implementation of this method is irrelevant when considering the lifetime of the 
    // returned Span<T>. The rules disallow capture of `parameter` hence the return of 
    // CreateSpan<T> is always safe-to-escape to the calling method
}
```

By the existing span safety rules the return of an invocation of this method always has a //*safe-to-escape* value of *calling method*. That is because in the span safety document `ref` fields do not exist and hence there is no way for the return to capture `parameter` hence there is no constraint on the return.  The implementation of the method is completely irrelevant here, which is why it's omitted from the sample, because there is simply no way for the `ref` to be captured. This means no matter how this method is called the return is *safe-to-escape* to the *calling method*.

This is not a hypothetical pattern, there are APIs today in .NET which have this basic structure. Very likely in customer code as well. One such example is [AsnDecoder.ReadEnumeratedBytes](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/3580ba795d92444e99fe5a5bfa4883458a0d4ac5/src/libraries/System.Formats.Asn1/src/System/Formats/Asn1/AsnDecoder.Enumerated.cs#L48-L52). 


```c#
Span<T> CompatExample(ref int p)
{
    // Okay
    int local = 42;
    return CreateSpan<int>(ref local);

    // Okay
    Span<T> span = stackalloc int[1];
    return CreateSpan<int>(ref span[0]);

    // Okay
    int[] array = new int[42];
    return CreatSpan(ref array[0]);
}
```

All of the above `return` statements are legal by our existing rules because the return of `CreateSpan` is always *safe-to-escape* to the *calling method*. The challenge in this proposal, which comes up many times, is they **must** remain legal in the version of the language which implements these features and / or when `Span<T>` moves to using `ref` fields. The above patterns can legally exist today and cannot become errors when moving to a new language version. 

Further the design must ensure that once `ref` fields exist that implementations of `CreateSpan<T>` cannot suddenly begin capture the input arguments by `ref`. For example: 

<a name="new-span-challenges"></a>

```c#
Span<int> UseSpan()
{
    // This code is 100% legal and safe in C# today. The span safety rules and .NET runtime 
    // ensure that CreateSpan **cannot** capture the parameter in the returned Span<T>. Hence
    // the result is always returnable. 
    // 
    // The rules created for ref fields must ensure this remains legal else it becomes a 
    // breaking change when moving to the new compiler.
    int local = 42;
    Span<int> span = CreateSpan(ref local);
    return span;
}

Span<T> CreateSpan<T>(ref T parameter)
{
    // This will create a length one Span<T> over the value referred to by `parameter`.
    // Effectively `span[0]` and `parameter` refer to the same location. 
    Span<T> span = new Span<T>(ref parameter);

    // Error: this must be illegal because our existing span safety rules assume the returned
    // Span<T> cannot capture `parameter`. Existing code could be using `CreateSpan(ref someLocal)`
    // and passing the returned Span<T> to the caller. That code is legal today and this 
    // proposal should not introduce new errors when calling CreateSpan<T>.
    //
    // Another way of thinking about this sample is that it can be safely done. It is only
    // returning references to values that live beyond this method call. But our existing
    // rules hide that this could be happening and callers do not account for it.
    return span;
}
```

It will be possible for such methods to exist. Specifically methods which take `ref` parameters, capture them in `ref` fields and return them. But they require a declarative opt-in to let the compiler, and developer, know that it is happening and to adjust the span safety rules accordingly.

It is important to understand these compat considerations before diving too far into the proposal here as they are central to parts of the design.

## Detailed Design 
The rules for `ref struct` safety are defined in the [span safety document](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-7.2/span-safety.md). This document will describe the required changes to this document as a result of this proposal. Once accepted as an approved feature these changes will be incorporated into that document.

### Provide ref fields
The language will allow developers to declare `ref` fields inside of a `ref struct`. This can be useful for example when encapsulating large mutable `struct` instances or defining high performance types like `Span<T>` in libraries besides the runtime.

The set of changes to our span safety rules necessary to allow `ref` fields is small and targeted. However this section of the proposal is quite involved. The reason is to make sure the reader understands both the new rules and **why** they were chosen. There are a number of subtle interactions between `ref` fields and our [compat considerations](#compat-considerations) that are easy to miss. This section is meant to call these out and explain how they fit into the chosen rules.

The [new Span<T> definition](#new-span) also reveals several [challenges](#new-span-challenges) that must be resolved for the lifetime of types that contain `ref` fields. They must both take into account the lifetime of captured values as well as the compat considerations.

The rules we define for `ref` fields must ensure the `Span<T>` constructor properly restricts the *safe-to-escape* scope of constructed objects in the cases it captures `ref` state. At the same time it must ensure that we don't break the existing consumption rules for methods like `CreateSpan<T>`. 

<a name="ref-fields-escape"></a>

To accomplish this the span safety rules will be changed as follows. First for the constructor of a `ref struct` that directly contains a `ref field`: 
- If the constructor is annotated with `[RefFieldEscapes]` then `ref` fields can be initialized with any value that has *ref-safe-to-escape* to the *calling method*
- Else `ref` fields can only be initialized with known heap values.

These rules ensure that the caller can understand when constructors will or will not capture parameters by `ref`. 

Next the rules for method invocation will change as follows when the target method is annotated with `[RefFieldEscapes]`:
- If the current method is not annotated with `[RefFieldEscapes]` then
    - If all arguments have a *ref-safe-to-escape* scope of *heap* then the *safe-to-escape* scope of the return is to the *calling method*
    - Else the *safe-to-escape* scope is to the *current method*
- Else the *safe-to-escape* scope of the return is the minimum of 
    - The existing *safe-to-escape* calculation for method invocation
    - All of the *ref-safe-to-escape* values of `ref`, `in` and `out` arguments

The design of `[RefFieldEscape]` will be discussed in detail [later in the proposal](#reffieldescapes).

Let's examine these rules in the context of samples to better understand their impact and how they maintain the required compat considerations.

```c#
ref struct RS
{
    ref int _field;

    public RS(int[] array, int index)
    {
        // Okay: even though there is no [RefFieldEscapes] annotation the fields are initialized
        // with known heap values
        _field = ref array[index];
    }

    [RefFieldEscapes]
    public RS(ref int i)
    {
        // Okay: the constructor is annotated with [RefFieldEscapes] which allows for fields to be
        // initialized with any value that is ref-safe-to-escape to calling method. That is the 
        // case for `i` hence this is legal
        _field = ref i;
    }

    public RS(ref (int, int) tuple)
    {
        // Error: even though the ref-safe-to-escape of `tuple.Item1` is to the calling method, the 
        // constructor is not annotated with [RefFieldEscapes] hence only known heap values are 
        // allowed
        _field = ref tuple.Item1;
    }

    static RS CreateRS(ref int parameter)
    {
        // Error: The RS(ref int) ctor is annotated as [RefFieldEscapes] however CreateRS is 
        // not annotated as [RefFieldEscapes] hence the safe-to-escape scope of `rs` is the
        // current method
        RS rs = new RS(ref parameter);
        return rs;

        // Okay: The RS(int[]) constructor is NOT marked as [RefFieldEscapes] hence it 
        // cannot capture any arguments by ref. It is implicitly safe-to-escape to calling 
        // method by all of our existing rules
        return new RS(new int[1]);
    }

    [RefFieldEscapes]
    static RS CreateRS2(ref int parameter)
    {
        // Okay: Both CreateRS2 and RS(ref int) are annotated as [RefFieldEscapes] hence the 
        // safe-to-escape scope of the return is the min of the ref-safe-to-escape scope of 
        // the ref / in arguments. In that case this is simply `parameter` which has a
        // ref-safe-to-escape scope of the calling method
        RS rs = new RS(ref parameter);
        return rs;

        int local = 42;

        // Error: This is the same analysis as above but in this case the ref-safe-to-escape 
        // scope of `local`is the current method hence the safe-to-escape scope of the 
        // constructor return is also the same.
        return new RS(ref local);

        // Okay: The RS(int[]) constructor is NOT marked as [RefFieldEscapes] hence it cannot 
        // capture any arguments by ref. It is implicitly safe-to-escape to calling method by
        // all of our existing rules
        return new RS(new int[1]);
    }

    // This method demonstrates that calling CreateRS2 has the same restrictions as RS(ref int) 
    // constructor. This demonstrates that factory methods are as flexible as constructors 
    // concerning `ref` field initialization
    [RefFieldEscapes] 
    static RS CreateRS3(ref int parameter)
    {
        // Okay: This method has [RefFieldEscapes] hence the safe-to-escape of `rs` is the minimim
        // of the ref-safe-to-escape of the arguments. In this case that is `parameter` which is 
        // to the calling method
        RS rs = new CreateRS2(ref parameter);
        return rs;

        int local = 42;

        // Error: In this case the ref-safe-to-escape of `local` is to the current method hence 
        // it is also the safe-to-escape of the method invocation.
        return new CreateRS2(ref local);
    }
}
```

The samples here have the same patterns as the [compat considerations](#compat-considerations) above. This means it will allow the introduction of `ref` fields without breaking existing code.

Constructor chaining needs to consider these new rules as well. When the original constructor calls a chained constructor via `:this(...)` the chained constructor effectively escapes from the original. That means a chained constructor call is only legal if the *safe-to-escape* value is not smaller than the original constructor one. This will be accomplished with the following rules:

- If the chained constructor has `[RefFieldEscapes]` 
    - If the original constructor has `[RefFieldEscapes]` then no additional checking is needed 
    - Else the chained constructor can only accept known heap values for all `ref` and `in` arguments.
- Else no additional checking is needed

```c#
ref struct RSChain
{
    ref int _field;

    [RefFieldEscapes]
    public RSChain(ref int value)
    {
        _field = ref value;
    }

    public RSChain(ref int value, string message)
        // Error: cannot chain to RSChain(ref int) because the lifetime may be smaller than 
        // the original 
        :this(ref int value) 
    {

    }
}
```

This proposal also requires that the span safety rules for field lifetimes be expanded as the rules today simply don't explicitly account for `ref` fields. It's important to note that our expansion of the rules here is not defining new behavior but rather accounting for behavior that has long existed. The safety rules around using `ref struct` fully acknowledge and account for the possibility that `ref struct` will contain `ref` state and that `ref` state will be exposed to consumers. The most prominent example of this is the indexer on `Span<T>`:

``` cs
readonly ref struct Span<T>
{
    public ref T this[int index] => ...; 
}
```

This directly exposes the `ref` state inside `Span<T>` and the span safety rules account for this. Whether that was implemented as `ByReference<T>` or `ref` fields is immaterial to those rules. This is true even though normal fields cannot be returned by `ref`. Effectively the rules have **always** allowed for the following: 

```c#
ref struct S
{
    int _field1;
    ref int _field2;

    internal ref int Prop1 => ref _field1;  // Error: can't escape `this` by ref
    internal ref int Prop2 => ref _field2;  // Okay 
}
```

As a part of allowing `ref` fields though we must define their rules such that they fit into the existing consumption rules for `ref struct`. Specifically this must account for the fact that it's legal *today* for a `ref struct` to return its `ref` state as `ref` to the consumer. 

To understand the proposed changes it's helpful to first review the existing rules for method invocation around *ref-safe-to-escape* and how they account for a `ref struct` exposing `ref` state today:

> An lvalue resulting from a ref-returning method invocation e1.M(e2, ...) is *ref-safe-to-escape* the smallest of the following scopes:
> 1. The entire enclosing method
> 2. The *ref-safe-to-escape* of all ref and out argument expressions (excluding the receiver)
> 3. For each in parameter of the method, if there is a corresponding expression that is an lvalue, its *ref-safe-to-escape*, otherwise the nearest enclosing scope
> 4. the *safe-to-escape* of all argument expressions (including the receiver)

The fourth item provides the critical safety point around a `ref struct` exposing `ref` state to callers. When the `ref` state stored in a `ref struct` refers to the stack then the *safe-to-escape* scope for that `ref struct` will be at most the scope which defines the state being referred to. Hence limiting the *ref-safe-to-escape* of invocations of a `ref struct` to the *safe-to-escape* scope of the receiver ensures the lifetimes are correct.

Consider as an example the indexer on `Span<T>` which is returning `ref` fields by `ref` today. The fourth item here is what provides the safety here:

```c#
ref int Examples()
{
    Span<int> s1 = stackalloc int[5];

    // Error: illegal because the *safe-to-escape* scope of `s1` is the current
    // method scope hence that limits the *ref-safe-to-escape" to the current
    // method scope as well.
    return ref s1[0];

    // Okay: legal because the *safe-to-escape* scope of `s2` is outside
    // the current method scope hence the *ref-safe-to-escape* is as well
    Span<int> s2 = default;
    return ref s2[0];
}
```

To account for `ref` fields the *ref-safe-to-escape* rules for fields will be adjusted to the following:

> An lvalue designating a reference to a field, e.F, is *ref-safe-to-escape* (by reference) as follows:
> 1. If `F` is a `ref` field and `e` is `this`, it is *ref-safe-to-escape* from the enclosing method.
> 2. Else if `F` is a `ref` field its *ref-safe-to-escape* scope is the *safe-to-escape* scope of `e`.
> 3. Else if `e` is of a reference type, it is *ref-safe-to-escape* from the enclosing method.
> 4. Else its *ref-safe-to-escape* is taken from the *ref-safe-to-escape* of `e`.

This explicitly allows for `ref` fields being returned as `ref` from a `ref struct` but not normal fields (that will be covered later). 

```c#
ref struct RS
{
    ref int _refField;
    int _field;

    // Okay: this falls into bullet one above. 
    public ref int Prop1 => ref _refField;

    // Error: This is bullet four above and the *ref-safe-to-escape* of `this`
    // in a `struct` is the current method scope.
    public ref int Prop2 => ref _field;

    public RS(int[] array)
    {
        _refField = ref array[0];
    }

    public RS(ref int i)
    {
        _refField = ref i;
    }

    public RS CreateRS() => ...;

    public ref int M1(RS rs)
    {
        ref int local1 = ref rs.Prop1;

        // Okay: this falls into bullet two above and the *safe-to-escape* of
        // `rs` is outside the current method scope. Hence the *ref-safe-to-escape*
        // of `local1` is outside the current method scope.
        return ref local;

        // Okay: this falls into bullet two above and the *safe-to-escape* of
        // `rs` is outside the current method scope. Hence the *ref-safe-to-escape*
        // of `local1` is outside the current method scope.
        //
        // In fact in this scenario you can guarantee that the value returned
        // from Prop1 must exist on the heap. 
        RS local2 = CreateRS();
        return ref local2.Prop1;

        // Error: the *safe-to-escape* of `local4` here is the current method 
        // scope by the revised constructor rules. This falls into bullet two 
        // above and hence based on that allowed scope.
        int local3 = 42;
        var local4 = new RS(ref local3);
        return ref local4.Prop1;

    }
}
```

The rules for `ref` assignment also need to be adjusted to account for `ref` fields.  This design only allows for `ref` assignment of a `ref` field during object construction or when the value is known to refer to the heap. Object construction includes in the constructor of the declaring type, inside `init` accessors and inside object initializer expressions. Further the `ref` being assigned to the `ref` field in this case must have *ref-safe-to-escape* greater than the receiver of the field: 

- Constructors: The value must be *ref-safe-to-escape* outside the constructor
- `init` accessors:  The value limited to values that are known to refer to the heap as accessors can't have `ref` parameters
- object initializers: The value can have any *ref-safe-to-escape* value as this will feed into the calculation of the *safe-to-escape* of the constructed object by existing rules.

A `ref` field can only be `ref` assigned outside a constructor when the value is known to have a lifetime greater than or equal to the receiver. Specifically: 
- A value that is known to refer to the heap is always allowed 
- A value which is *safe-to-escape* to the *calling method* can be assigned to a `ref` field where the receiver is *safe-to-escape* within the *current method*
- A value which is *safe-to-escape* to the *calling method* **cannot** be assigned to a `ref` field where the receiver is *safe-to-escape* to the *calling method*. In that situation it cannot be asserted that the field outlives the receiver.

This design does not allow for general `ref` field `ref `assignment outside object construction due to existing limitations on lifetimes. Specifically it poses challenges for scenarios like the following:

```c#
ref struct SmallSpan
{
    public ref int _field;

    // Notice once again we're back at the same problem as the original 
    // CreateSpan method: a method returning a ref struct and taking a ref
    // parameter
    SmallSpan TrickyRefAssignment(ref int i)
    {
        // *safe-to-escape* is outside the current method by current rules.
        SmallSpan s = default;

        // The *ref-safe-to-escape* of 'i' is the same as the *safe-to-escape*
        // of 's' hence most assignment rules would allow it.
        s._field = ref i;

        // Error: this must be disallowed for the exact same reasons we can't 
        // return a Span<T> wrapping the parameter: the consumption rules
        // believe such state smuggling cannot exist
        return s;
    }

    SmallSpan SafeRefAssignment()
    {
        int[] array = new int[] { 42, 13 };
        SmallSpan s = default;

        // Okay: the value being assigned here is known to refer to the heap 
        // hence it is allowed by our rules above because it requires no changes
        // to existing method invocation rules (hence preserves compat)
        s._field = ref array[i];

        return s;
    }

    SmallSpan BadUsage()
    {
        // Legal today and must remain legal (and safe)
        int i = 0;
        return TrickyRefAssignment(ref i);
    }
}
```

There are designs choices we could make to allow more flexible `ref` re-assignment of fields. For example it could be allowed in cases where we knew the receiver had a *safe-to-escape* scope that was not outside the current method scope. Further we could provide syntax for making such downward facing values easier to declare: essentially values that have *safe-to-escape* scopes restricted to the current method. Such a design is discussed [here](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/1130)). However extra complexity of such rules do not seem to be worth the limited cases this enables. Should compelling samples come up we can revisit this decision.

This means though that `ref` fields are largely in practice `readonly ref`. The main exceptions being object initializers and when the value is known to refer to the heap.

A `ref` field will be emitted into metadata using the `ELEMENT_TYPE_BYREF` signature. This is no different than how we emit `ref` locals or `ref` arguments. For example `ref int _field` will be emitted as `ELEMENT_TYPE_BYREF ELEMENT_TYPE_I4`. This will require us to update ECMA335 to allow this entry but this should be rather straight forward.

Developers can continue to initialize a `ref struct` with a `ref` field using the `default` expression in which case all declared `ref` fields will have the value `null`. Any attempt to use such fields will result in a `NullReferenceException` being thrown.

```c#
struct S1 
{
    public ref int Value;
}

S1 local = default;
local.Value.ToString(); // throws NullReferenceException
```

While the C# language pretends that a `ref` cannot be `null` this is legal at the runtime level and has well defined semantics. Developers who introduce `ref` fields into their types need to be aware of this possibility and should be **strongly** discouraged from leaking this detail into consuming code. Instead `ref` fields should be validated as non-null using the [runtime helpers](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40008) and throwing when an uninitialized `struct` is used incorrectly.

```c#
struct S1 
{
    private ref int Value;

    public int GetValue()
    {
        if (System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.IsNullRef(ref Value))
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException(...);
        }

        return Value;
    }
}
```

The `ref` fields feature requires runtime support and changes to the ECMA spec to allow the construct. As such these will only be enabled when the corresponding feature flag is set in corelib. The issue tracking the exact API is tracked here 

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/64165

Detailed Notes:
- A `ref` field can only be declared inside of a `ref struct` 
- A `ref` field cannot be declared `static`
- A `ref` field can only be `ref` assigned 
    - in the constructor of the declaring type
    - when the RHS is known to be a heap location
- The reference assembly generation process must preserve the presence of a `ref` field inside a `ref struct` 
- A `readonly ref struct` must declare its `ref` fields as `readonly ref`
- The span safety rules for constructors, fields and assignment must be updated as outlined in this document.
- The span safety rules need to include the definition of `ref` values that "refer to the heap". 

### Provide lifetime annotations
The [span safety document](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/csharp-7.2/span-safety.md) assigns escape scopes to locations based on their declaration: parameters are *ref-safe-to-escape* to calling method, `this` in a `struct` is *ref-safe-to-escape* within the current method, etc ... These defaults were chosen to make `Span<T>` and `ref` returns work with the predominant coding patterns in .NET.

While the defaults have allowed broad adoption of `ref struct` within .NET they do create a number of friction points in low level code. For example the inability to return fields of `struct` by `ref` from instance methods. These friction points often force developers to resort to using `unsafe` which de-values our `ref struct` efforts. 

The lifetime defaults for these locations is not fundamental to correctness. For example parameters could default to *ref-safe-to-escape* to within the current method or `this` in a `struct` could be *ref-safe-to-escape* to the calling method in our span safety rules and it would not make `ref struct` usage unsafe. It would simply impact the usability of the resulting feature.

This, and several other friction points, can be removed if the language provides developers a way to invert the defaults by applying attributes to specific locations. The language can recognize these attributes and simply adjust the lifetime calculation for locations when evaluating span safety.

#### RefThisEscapes
One of the most notable friction points is the inability to return fields by `ref` in instance members of a `struct`. This means developers can't create `ref` returning methods / properties and have to resort to exposing fields directly. This reduces the usefulness of `ref` returns in `struct` where it is often the most desired. 

```c#
struct S
{
     int _field;

    // Error: this, and hence _field, can't return by ref
    public ref int Prop => ref _field;
}
```

The [rationale](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/csharp-7.2/span-safety.md#struct-this-escape) for this default is reasonable but there is nothing inherently wrong with a `struct` escaping `this` by reference, it is simply the default chosen by the span safety rules. 

To fix this the attribute `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RefThisEscapesAttribute` will be used to specify that `this` is *ref-safe-to-escape* to the calling method. It can be applied to individual methods or properties in `struct`. When applied to `struct` declaration itself it is treated as if it were applied to all methods / properties in the type. 

```c#
// Option 1 
struct S
{
    int _field;

    // The ref-safe-to-escape for this is now the calling method hence this is legal
    [RefThisEscapes]
    public ref int Prop => ref _field;
}

// Option 2 
// The ref-safe-to-escape for this is now the calling method on all members
[RefThisEscapes]
struct S
{
    int _field;

    public ref int Prop => ref _field;
}
```

This will naturally, by the existing rules in the span safety spec, allow for returning transitive fields in addition to direct fields.

```c#
[RefThisEscapes]
struct Child
{
    int _value;
    public ref int Value => ref _value;
}

[RefThisEscapes] 
struct Container
{
    Child _child;

    // In this case the ref-safe-to-escape of `_child` is to the calling method because that is 
    // the value of `this` and fields derive it from their receiver. From there method invocation 
    // rules take over 
    public ref int Value => ref _child.Value;
}
```

This require the following changes to the span safety document: 

- The method invocation rules will include the *ref-safe-to-escape* value of the receiver when it is marked by `[RefThisEscapes]`
- The parameter lifetime rules will change to note that the *ref-safe-to-escape* of `this` is dependent on `[RefThisEscapes]`

Detailed Notes:
- An instance method or property annotated with `[RefThisEscapes]` has *ref-safe-to-escape* of `this` set to the *calling method*
- A `struct` annotated with `[RefThisEscapes]` has the same effect of annotating every instance method and property with `[RefThisEscapes]`
- A member annotated with `[RefThisEscapes]` cannot implement an interface.
- It is an error to use `[RefThisEscapes]` on 
    - Any type other than a `struct` (although it is legal for all variations like `readonly struct`)
    - Any member that is not declared on a `struct`
    - Any `static` member or constructor on a `struct`

#### RefFieldEscapes
Methods that return `ref struct` that capture `ref` parameters as fields must declare that they do so. Otherwise it would violate our [compat requirements](#compat-considerations).  This will be done by annotating such methods with `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RefFieldEscapesAttribute`. 

This attribute can be applied to methods, constructors and operators. Applying to any other member will be an error. 

The semantics of this attribute, and how it impacts span safety rules, are described [above](#ref-fields-escape)

#### DoesNotEscape
One source of repeated friction in low level code is the default escape for parameters is permissive. They are *safe-to-escape* to the *calling method*. This is a sensible default because it lines up with the coding patterns of .NET as a whole. In low level code though there is a larger use of  `ref struct` and this default can cause friction with other parts of the span safety rules.

The main friction point occurs because of the following constraint around method invocations:

> For a method invocation if there is a ref or out argument of a ref struct type (including the receiver), with safe-to-escape E1, then no argument (including the receiver) may have a narrower safe-to-escape than E1

This rule most commonly comes into play with instance methods on `ref struct` where at least one parameter is also a `ref struct`. This is a common pattern in low level code where `ref struct` types commonly leverage `Span<T>` parameters in their methods. For example it will occur on any writer style `ref struct` that uses `Span<T>` to pass around buffers.

This rule exists to prevent scenarios like the following:

```c#
ref struct RS
{
    Span<int> _field;
    void Set(Span<int> p)
    {
        _field = p;
    }

    static void DangerousCode(ref RS p)
    {
        Span<int> span = stackalloc int[] { 42 };

        // Error: if allowed this would let the method return a reference to 
        // the stack
        p.Set(span);
    }
}
```

Essentially this rule exists because the language must assume that all inputs to a method escape to their maximum allowed scope. When there are `ref` or `out` parameters, including the receivers, it's possible for the inputs to escape as fields of those `ref` values (as happens in `RS.Set` above).

In practice though there are many such methods which pass `ref struct` as parameters that never intend to capture them in output. It is just a value that is used within the current method. For example:

```c#
ref struct JsonReader
{
    Span<char> _buffer;
    int _position;

    internal bool TextEquals(ReadOnySpan<char> text)
    {
        var current = _buffer.Slice(_position, text.Length);
        return current == text;
    }
}

class C
{
    static void M(ref JsonReader reader)
    {
        Span<char> span = stackalloc char[4];
        span[0] = 'd';
        span[1] = 'o';
        span[2] = 'g';

        // Error: The safe-to-escape of `span` is the current method scope 
        // while `reader` is outside the current method scope hence this fails
        // by the above rule.
        if (reader.TextEquals(span)
        {
            ...
        })
    }
}
```

In order to work around this low level code will resort to `unsafe` tricks to lie to the compiler about the lifetime of their `ref struct`. This significantly reduces the value proposition of `ref struct` as they are meant to be a means to avoid `unsafe` while continuing to write high performance code.

The other place where parameter default escape scope causes friction is when they are re-assigned within a method body. For instance if a method body decides to conditionally apply escaping to input by using stack allocated values. Once again this runs into some friction.

```c#
void WriteData(ReadOnlySpan<char> data)
{
    if (data.Contains(':'))
    {
        Span<char> buffer = stackalloc char[256];
        Escape(data, buffer, out var length);

        // Error: Cannot assign `buffer` to `data` here as the safe-to-escape
        // scope of `buffer` is to the current method scope while `data` is
        // outside the current method scope
        data = buffer.Slice(0, length);
    }

    WriteDataCore(data);
}
```

This pattern is fairly common across .NET code and it works just fine when a `ref struct` is not involved. Once users adopt `ref struct` though it forces them to change their patterns here and often they just resort to `unsafe` to work around the limitations here.

To remove this friction the language will provide the attribute `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DoesNotEscapeAttribute`. This can be applied to non-ref parameters of methods and when done it changes the *safe-to-escape* scope to the current method. 

```c#
class C
{
    static Span<int> M1(Span<int> p1, [DoesNotEscape] Span<int> p2)
    {
        // Okay: the safe-to-escape here is still outside the enclosing scope
        // of the current method.
        return p1; 

        // Error: the [DoesNotEscape] attribute changes the safe-to-escape*
        // to be limited to the current method scope. Hence it cannot be 
        // returned
        return p2; 

        // Error: `local` has the same safe-to-escape as `p2` hence it cannot
        // be returned.
        Span<int> local = p2;
        return local; 
    }
}
```

This attribute cannot be used on `ref` or `out` parameters. Those always implicitly escape to the calling method (that is how `ref` works). Instead `in` is likely a more appropriate designation for those scenarios.

To account for this change the "Parameters" section of the span safety document will be updated to include the following bullet:

- If the parameter is marked with `[DoesNotEscape]` it is *safe-to-escape* to the *current method*

It's important to note that this will naturally block the ability for such parameters to escape by being stored as fields. Receivers that are passed by `ref`, or `this` on `ref struct`, have a *safe-to-escape* scope outside the current method. Hence assignment from a `[DoesNotEscape]` parameter to a field on such a value fails by existing field assignment rules: the scope of the receiver is greater than the value being assigned.

```c#
ref struct S
{
    Span<int> _field;

    void M1(Span<int> p1, [DoesNotEscape] Span<int> p2)
    {
        // Okay: the *safe-to-escape* here is still outside the enclosing scope
        // of the current method and hence the same as the receiver.
        _field = p1;

        // Error: the [DoesNotEscape] attribute changes the *safe-to-escape* 
        // to be limited to the current method scope. Hence it cannot be 
        // assigned to a receiver that has a *safe-to-escape* scope outside the 
        // current method.
        _field = p2;
    }
}
```

Given that parameters are restricted in this way we will also update the "Method Invocation" section to relax its rules. In all cases where it is considering the *safe-to-escape* lifetimes of arguments the spec will change to ignore those arguments which line up to parameters which are marked as `[DoesNotEscape]`. Because these arguments cannot escape their lifetime does not need to be considered when considering the lifetime of returned values.

For example the last line of calculating *safe-to-escape* of returns will change to 

> the safe-to-escape of all argument expressions including the receiver. **This will exclude all arguments that line up with parameters marked as [DoesNotEscape]**

Detailed Notes:
- The `[DoesNotEscape]` and `[RefThisEscapes]` cannot be combined on the same method 
- The `[DoesNotEscape]` attribute cannot be used on parameters that are `ref`, `out` or `in`.

### Safe fixed size buffers
The language will relax the restrictions on fixed sized arrays such that they can be declared in safe code and the element type can be managed or unmanaged.  This will make types like the following legal:

```c#
internal struct CharBuffer
{
    internal char Data[128];
}
```

These declarations, much like their `unsafe` counter parts, will define a sequence of `N` elements in the containing type. These members can be accessed with an indexer and can also be converted to `Span<T>` and `ReadOnlySpan<T>` instances.

When indexing into a `fixed` buffer of type `T` the `readonly` state of the container must be taken into account.  If the container is `readonly` then the indexer returns `ref readonly T` else it returns `ref T`. 

Accessing a `fixed` buffer without an indexer has no natural type however it is convertible to `Span<T>` types. In the case the container is `readonly` the buffer is implicitly convertible to `ReadOnlySpan<T>`, else it can implicitly convert to `Span<T>` or `ReadOnlySpan<T>` (the `Span<T>` conversion is considered *better*). 

The resulting `Span<T>` instance will have a length equal to the size declared on the `fixed` buffer. The *safe-to-escape* scope of the returned value will be equal to the *safe-to-escape* scope of the container, just as it would if the backing data was accessed as a field.

For each `fixed` declaration in a type where the element type is `T` the language will generate a corresponding `get` only indexer method whose return type is `ref T`. The indexer will be annotated with the `[RefThisEscapes]` attribute as the implementation will be returning fields of the declaring type. The accessibility of the member will match the accessibility on the `fixed` field.

For example, the signature of the indexer for `CharBuffer.Data` will be the following:

```c#
[RefThisEscapes]
internal ref char <>DataIndexer(int index) => ...;
```

If the provided index is outside the declared bounds of the `fixed` array then an `IndexOutOfRangeException` will be thrown. In the case a constant value is provided then it will be replaced with a direct reference to the appropriate element. Unless the constant is outside the declared bounds in which case a compile time error would occur.

There will also be a named accessor generated for each `fixed` buffer that provides by value `get` and `set` operations. Having this means that `fixed` buffers will more closely resemble existing array semantics by having a `ref` accessor as well as byval `get` and `set` operations. This means compilers will have the same flexibility when emitting code consuming `fixed` buffers as they do when consuming arrays. This should be operations like `await` over `fixed` buffers easier to emit. 

This also has the added benefit that it will make `fixed` buffers easier to consume from other languages. Named indexers is a feature that has existed since the 1.0 release of .NET. Even languages which cannot directly emit a named indexer can generally consume them (C# is actually a good example of this).

The backing storage for the buffer will be generated using the `[InlineArray]` attribute. This is a mechanism discussed in [issue 12320](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/12320) which allows specifically for the case of efficiently declaring sequence of fields of the same type. This particular issue is still under active discussion and the expectation is that the implementation of this feature will follow however that discussion goes.

## Considerations

### Keywords vs. attributes
This design calls for using attributes to annotate the new lifetime rules. This also could've been done just as easily with contextual keywords. For instance: `scoped` and `escapes` could have been used instead of `DoesNotEscape` and `RefThisEscapes`.

Keywords, even the contextual ones, have a much heavier weight in the language than attributes. The use cases these features solve, while very valuable, impact a small number of developers. Consider that only a fraction of high end developers are defining `ref struct` instances and then consider that only a fraction of those developers will be using these new lifetime features.  That doesn't seem to justify adding a new contextual keyword to the language.

This does mean that program correctness will be defined in terms of attributes though. That is a bit of a gray area for the language side of things but an established pattern for the runtime. 

### Why do we need [RefFieldEscapes]?
The biggest challenge posed by the [compat considerations](#compat-considerations) is that methods cannot capture and return `ref` parameters as `ref` fields. This is a hard assumption in the rules and there are many API patterns today that take advantage of this. In order to have methods that capture `ref` parameters as `ref` fields there must be some form of explicit opt-in that is visible to calling methods.

Several ideas for having implicit opt-in to `ref` capture were explored and discarded: 

- Special casing constructors. It is possible to have constructors of `ref struct` that **directly** define `ref` fields be implicitly opt-in to `[RefFieldEscapes]` semantics. However this does not generalize to factory methods and hence is not a general solution that we can use.
- Special casing methods that return `ref struct` that define a `ref`. There are no such methods today because `ref` fields do not exist hence we could say that methods which return `ref struct` that defined a `ref` field have opted-in to `[ReFFieldsEscape]` semantics. This works but it essentially prevents any existing `ref struct` from adding `ref` fields. Doing so would cause span safety rules to be interpreted differently in all methods that returned the type. 

These implicit opt-in strategies all have significant holes while an explicit opt-in is fully generalizable and makes the span safety rule different explicit in the code.

### Reference Assemblies
A reference assembly for a compilation using features described in this proposal must maintain the elements that convey span safety information. That means all lifetime annotation attributes and `[RefFieldEscapes]` must be preserved in their original position. Any attempt to replace or omit them can lead to invalid reference assemblies.

Representing `ref` fields is more nuanced. Ideally a `ref` field would appear in a reference assembly as would any other field. However a `ref` field represents a change to the metadata format and that can cause issues with tool chains that are not updated to understand this metadata change. A concrete example is C++/CLI which will likely error if it consumes a `ref` field. Hence it's advantageous if `ref` fields can be omitted from reference assemblies in our core libraries. 

A `ref` field by itself has no impact on span safety rules. As a concrete example consider that flipping the existing `Span<T>` definition to use a `ref` field has no impact on consumption. Hence the `ref` itself can be omitted safely. However a `ref` field does have other impacts to consumption that must be preserved: 

- A `ref struct` which has a `ref` field is never considered `unmanaged` 
- The type of the `ref` field impacts infinite generic expansion rules. Hence if the type of a `ref` field contains a type parameter that must be preserved 

Given those rules here is a valid reference assembly transformation for a `ref struct`: 

```c#
// Impl assembly 
ref struct S<T> {
    ref T _field;
}

// Ref assembly 
ref struct S<T> {
    object _o; // force managed 
    T _f; // mantain generic expansion protections
}
```

## Open Issues

### Take the breaking change
Consider for a minute a design where the compat problem was approached from the other direction. Effectively make it such that every method was implicitly `[RefFieldsEscape]` and then have an attribute that restores the span safety rules in place today. Say `[RefFieldDoesNotEscape]`. 

This would be a breaking change and it's easy to construct code samples that trigger an error when upgrading to a new version of C# (as demonstrated [here](#new-span-challenges)). It's hard to determine though how prevalent these types of patterns are. Essentially methods which have both the following attributes:

- Have a `Span<T>` or `ref struct` which has a `Span<T>` as
    - The return type 
    - A `ref` or `out` parameter
- Take a `ref`, `in` or `out` parameter 

If this is very low then it's possible that a breaking change could be acceptable here. 

The challenge though is the breaking change and the fix for the breaking change are possible in different libraries. Consider the following:

```c#
// Widget.Library.dll
Span<int> CreateSpan(ref int i)
{
    ...
    return new Span<int>(new int[i]);
}

// App.exe
Span<int> Method()
{
    int local = 42;
    var span = CreateSpan(ref local);
    return span;
}
```

Imagine if the order here is `Widget.Library.dll` moved to C# 11 first. That implicitly moved `CreateSpan` to `[RefFieldEscapes]` behavior silently. The code was legal before hence the move to the new rules will silently succeed. A new version is shipped to NuGet.org. Now the App.exe author upgrades to the new version and suddenly they cannot compile. The compiler operating by the new rules says `span` is only *safe-to-escape* to the current method and flags the `return` as an error. The author of App.exe is stuck because the fix is for `CreateSpan` to be marked as `[RefFieldDoesNotEscape]`. The only recourse is `unsafe` code.

### Allow fixed buffer locals
This design allows for safe `fixed` buffers that can support any type. One possible extension here is allowing such `fixed` buffers to be declared as local variables. This would allow a number of existing `stackalloc` operations to be replaced with a `fixed` buffer. It would also expand the set of scenarios we could have stack style allocations as `stackalloc` is limited to unmanaged element types while `fixed` buffers are not. 

```c#
class FixedBufferLocals
{
    void Example()
    {
        Span<int> span = stakalloc int[42];
        int buffer[42];
    }
}
```

This holds together but does require us to extend the syntax for locals a bit.  Unclear if this is or isn't worth the extra complexity. Possible we could decide no for now and bring back later if sufficient need is demonstrated.

Example of where this would be beneficial: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/34149

### To use modreqs or not
A decision needs to be made if methods marked with new life time attributes should or should not contain a `modreq`. The target of the `modreq` would simply be the attribute in question. Or there would be a single attribute, `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.LifetimeAnnotations`, for which a `modreq` is added if any of the lifetime attributes are used. 

The rationale for adding a `modreq` is the attributes change the semantics of span safety. Only languages which understand these semantics should be calling the methods in question. 

The worry is whether or not this is overkill. No `modreq` were used in the initial span safety work and instead the framework relied on languages understanding and implementing the new rules. In cases like `[RefThisEscapes]` on a `struct` declaration would result in every single member having a `modreq`. It's questionable if that is worth the trade off

### Allow multi-dimensional fixed buffers
Should the design for `fixed` buffers be extended to include multi-dimensional style arrays? Essentially allowing for declarations like the following:

```c#
struct Dimensions
{
    int array[42, 13];
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Allowing attributes on locals
Another friction point for developers using `ref struct` is local variables can suffer from the same issues as parameters with respect to their lifetimes being decided at declaration. Than can make it difficult to work with `ref struct` that are assigned on multiple paths where at least one of the paths is a limited *safe-to-escape* scope. 

```c#
int length = ...;
Span<byte> span;
if (length > StackAllocLimit)
{
    span = new Span(new byte[length]);
}
else
{
    // Error: The *safe-to-escape* of `span` was decided to be outside the 
    // current method scope hence it can't be the target of a stackalloc
    span = stackalloc byte[length];
}
```

For `Span<T>` specifically developers can work around this by initializing the local with a `stackalloc` of size zero. This changes the *safe-to-escape* scope to be the current method and is optimized away by the compiler. It's effectively a syntax for making a `[DoesNotEscape]` local.

```c#
int length = ...;
Span<byte> span = stackalloc byte[0];
if (length > StackAllocLimit)
{
    span = new Span(new byte[length]);
}
else
{
    // Okay
    span = stackalloc byte[length];
}
```

This only works for `Span<T>` though, there is no general purpose mechanism for `ref struct` values. However the `[DoesNotEscape]` attribute provides exactly the semantics that are desired here. If we decide in the future to allow attributes to apply to local variables it would provide immediate relief to this scenario.

### Existing samples

[Utf8JsonReader](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f1a7cb3fdd7ffc4ce7d996b7ac6867ffe2c953b9/src/libraries/System.Text.Json/src/System/Text/Json/Reader/Utf8JsonReader.cs#L523-L528)

This particular snippet requires unsafe because it runs into issues with passing around a `Span<T>` which can be stack allocated to an instance method on a `ref struct`. Even though this parameter is not captured the language must assume it is and hence needlessly causes friction here.

[Utf8JsonWriter](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f1a7cb3fdd7ffc4ce7d996b7ac6867ffe2c953b9/src/libraries/System.Text.Json/src/System/Text/Json/Writer/Utf8JsonWriter.WriteProperties.String.cs#L122-L127)

This snippet wants to mutate a parameter by escaping elements of the data. The escaped data can be stack allocated for efficiency. Even though the parameter is not escaped the compiler assigns it a *safe-to-escape* scope of outside the enclosing method because it is a parameter. This means in order to use stack allocation the implementation must use `unsafe` in order to assign back to the parameter after escaping the data.

            }

            return ref _next;
        }
    }

    public StackLinkedListNode(T value)
    {
        this = default;
