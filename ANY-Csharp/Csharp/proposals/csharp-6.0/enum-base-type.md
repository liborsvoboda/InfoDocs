## Enum Base Type

In C# 6.0 we relaxed the syntax of an enum base type to be a type syntax, but require that it bind to one of a specified set of types. So `System.Int32` is permitted. But the spec has not been updated; it still requires one of a set of keywords for the base.

This is a placeholder for a specification of that change.
