Locations of sample databases and code samples for Microsoft SQL products.

## SQL samples repository

Code samples for SQL products are in the [Microsoft SQL Server samples](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples) GitHub repository. Each sample includes a README file that explains how to run and use the sample. The main README for the samples repository explains how to contribute. 

The samples and templates are all licensed under the MIT license. See the license.txt file in the root.

## AdventureWorks sample database

AdventureWorks databases can be found on the [installation](adventureworks-install-configure.md) page or directly within the [SQL Server samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples) GitHub repository. 


## Azure samples and templates
There are a number of Microsoft Azure code samples and examples available on Github in .NET, Java, Python, Node.js, PHP and Ruby. Additionally, Azure Resource Manager allows you to provision your applications using a declarative template. In a single template, you can deploy multiple services along with their dependencies. You use the same template to repeatedly deploy your application during every stage of the application lifecycle.
