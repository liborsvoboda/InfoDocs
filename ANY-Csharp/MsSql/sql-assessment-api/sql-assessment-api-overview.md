# SQL Assessment API

SQL Assessment API provides a mechanism to evaluate the configuration of your SQL Server for best practices. The API is delivered with a ruleset containing best practice rules suggested by SQL Server Team. This ruleset is enhancing with the release of new versions but at the same time, the API is built with the intent to give a highly customizable and extensible solution. So, users can tune the default rules and create their own ones.

SQL Assessment API is useful when you want to make sure your SQL Server configuration is in line with recommended best practices. After an initial assessment, configuration stability can be tracked by regularly scheduled assessments.

The API can be used to assess Azure SQL Database Managed Instance and SQL Server versions 2012 and higher. SQL on Linux is supported.

## Rules

Rules sometimes referred to as checks, are defined in JSON formatted files. Ruleset format requires a ruleset name and version to be specified. So when you use custom rulesets, you can easily know which recommendations from what ruleset come. 

Microsoft's shipped ruleset is available on GitHub. You can visit the [samples repository](https://aka.ms/sql-assessment-api) for more details.

## SQL Assessment cmdlets and SMO extension

SQL Assessment API is part of the [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/installing-smo.md) July 2019 release version and higher and the [SQL Server PowerShell module](../powershell/download-sql-server-ps-module.md) July 2019 release version and higher.

* [Install SMO](../relational-databases/server-management-objects-smo/installing-smo.md)

* [Install SQL Server PowerShell module](../powershell/download-sql-server-ps-module.md)

SqlServer module is getting two new cmdlets to work with SQL Assessment API:

* **Get-SqlAssessmentItem** – Provides a list of available assessment checks for a SQL Server object

* **Invoke-SqlAssessment** – Provides results of an assessment

SMO Framework is supplemented by the SQL Assessment API extension that provides the following methods:

* **GetAssessmentItems** – Returns available checks for a particular SQL object (IEnumerable<…>)

* **GetAssessmentResults** – Synchronously evaluates assessment and returns results and errors if any (IEnumerable<…>)

* **GetAssessmentResultsList** – Asynchronously evaluates assessment and returns results and errors if any (Task<…>)

## Get started using SQL Assessment cmdlets

An assessment is performed against a chosen SQL Server object. In the default ruleset, there are checks for two kinds of objects only: Server and Database (in addition to them, the API supports two more kinds: Filegroup and AvailabilityGroup). If you want to assess a SQL instance and all its databases, you should run the SQL Assessment cmdlets for each object separately. Or you can pass objects for assessment to the SQL Assessment cmdlets in a variable or the pipeline.

SqlServer and RegisteredServer objects are interchangeable, so you can pass any to the SQL Assessment cmdlets.

Go through the examples below to get started.

1. Get a list of available checks for a local default instance to familiarize yourself with the checks. In this example, we're piping the output of the Get-SqlInstance cmdlet to the Get-SqlAssessmentItem cmdlet to pass the instance object to it.

    ```powershell
    Get-SqlInstance -ServerInstance 'localhost' | Get-SqlAssessmentItem
    ```

2. Get a list of available checks for all databases of the instance. Here, we're using the Get-Item cmdlet and a path implemented with the Windows PowerShell SQL Server provider to get a list of the databases, and then piping it to the Get-SqlDatabase cmdlet.

    ```powershell
    Get-Item SQLSERVER:\SQL\localhost\default | Get-SqlAssessmentItem
    ```

    Also, you can use the Get-SqlDatabase cmdlet to do the same.

    ```powershell
    Get-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance 'localhost' | Get-SqlAssessmentItem
    ```

3. Get a list of available checks for all databases of the instance. Here, we're using the Get-Item cmdlet and a path implemented with the Windows PowerShell SQL Server provider to get a list of the databases, and then piping it to the Get-SqlDatabase cmdlet.

    ```powershell
    Get-Item SQLSERVER:\SQL\localhost\default | Get-SqlAssessmentItem
    ```

    Also, you can use the Get-SqlDatabase cmdlet to do the same.

    ```powershell
    Get-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance 'localhost' | Get-SqlAssessmentItem
    ```

4. Invoke assessment for the instance and save the results to a SQL table. In this example, we're piping the output of the Get-SqlInstance cmdlet to the Invoke-SqlAssessment cmdlet, which results are piped to the Write-SqlTableData cmdlet. The Invoke-Assessment cmdlet is run with the `-FlattenOutput` parameter in this example. This parameter makes the output suitable for the Write-SqlTableData cmdlet. The latter raises an error if you omit the parameter.

    ```powershell
    Get-SqlInstance -ServerInstance 'localhost' |
    Invoke-SqlAssessment -FlattenOutput |
    Write-SqlTableData -ServerInstance 'localhost' -DatabaseName SQLAssessmentDemo -SchemaName Assessment -TableName Results -Force
    ```

    Now let's invoke an assessment for all databases of the instance and add the results to the same table.

    ```powershell
    Get-SqlDatabase -ServerInstance 'localhost' |
    Invoke-SqlAssessment -FlattenOutput |
    Write-SqlTableData -ServerInstance 'localhost' -DatabaseName SQLAssessmentDemo -SchemaName Assessment -TableName Results -Force
    ```

5. Follow descriptions and links in the table to further understand the recommendations.

6. Customize the rules based on your environment and organizational requirements (see below).

7. Schedule a task or a job to run the assessment regularly or on-demand to measure progress.

## Customizing rules

Rules are designed to be customizable and extensible. Microsoft's ruleset is designed to work for most environments. However, it's impossible to have one ruleset that works for every single environment. Users can write their own JSON files and customize existing rules or add new ones. Examples of customization and complete Microsoft released ruleset are available in the [samples repository](https://aka.ms/sql-assessment-api). For more details on how to run the SQL Assessment cmdlets with custom JSON files, use the Get-Help cmdlet.

### Options available with rule customization feature

#### Enabling/disabling certain rules or groups of rules (using tags)

You can silence specific rules when they aren't applied to your environment or until scheduled work is done to rectify the issue.

#### Changing threshold parameters

Specific rules have thresholds that are compared against the current value of a metric to find out an issue. If the default thresholds don't fit, you can change them.

#### Adding more rules written by you or third parties

You can string together rulesets by adding one or more JSON files as parameters to your SQL Assessment API call. Your organization might write those files or obtain them from a third party. For example, you can have your JSON file that disables specific rules from the Microsoft ruleset, and another JSON file by an industry expert that include rules you find useful for your environment, followed by another JSON file that changes some threshold values in that JSON file.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> We urge you not to use rulesets that come from untrusted sources until you thoroughly review them to make sure they are safe.
