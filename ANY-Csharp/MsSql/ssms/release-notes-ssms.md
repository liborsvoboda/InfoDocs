# Release notes for SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-xxx-md.md](../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-asdw-xxx-md.md)]

This article provides details about updates, improvements, and bug fixes for the current and previous versions of SSMS.

<!--
The latest ## H2 section of this Release Notes article has been reformatted to match the new standard.
The new standard replaces the use of bullet lists with the 2-column markdown table format.
Please use the new 2-column table format going forward.
And please do include the final blank row of "| &nbsp;| &nbsp;|".

The ## H2 titles are also being shortened, by the removal of unnecessary repetitive strings.
In this case, "## SSMS 17.9" is being shortened to "## 17.9" (as one standard actual example).
Also, we are appending the 'Month yyyy.'

Also, this file has been renamed to the new standard, which calls for the file name to be with "release-notes-[techAreaName].md."
The old name for this file was 'sql-server-management-studio-changelog-ssms.md'.
But today the new file name is 'release-notes-ssms.md' (still in 'docs/ssms/').

Thank you.

Release number: 18.2  
Build number: 15.0.18142.0  
Release date: July 25, 2019

18.2 is an update to 18.1 with the following new items and bug fixes.

|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integration Services (SSIS) | Perf optimization for SSIS package scheduler in Azure. |
| Intellisense/Editor | Added support for Data Classification. |
| OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY | Added Intellisense support. |
| OPTIMIZE_FOR_SEQUENTIAL_KEY | Turns on an optimization within the database engine that helps improve throughput for high-concurrency inserts into the index. This option is intended for indexes that are prone to last-page insert contention, typically seen with indexes that have a sequential key such as an identity column, sequence, or date/time column. See [CREATE INDEX](../t-sql/statements/create-index-transact-sql.md#sequential-keys) for more details. |
| Query Execution or Results | Added a *Completion time* in the messages to track when a given query completed its execution. |
| Query Execution or Results | Allow more data to be displayed (Result to Text) and stored in cells (Result to Grid). SSMS now allows up to 2M characters for both (up from 256 K   and 64 K, respectively). This also addressed the issue of users not able to grab more than 43680 chars from the cells of the grid. |
| ShowPlan | Added a new attribute in QueryPlan when [inline scalar UDF feature](../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#scalar-udf-inlining) is enabled  (ContainsInlineScalarTsqludfs). |
| SMO | Added support for *SQL Assessment API*. For more information, see [SQL Assessment API](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/sql-assessment-api/sql-assessment-api-overview). |
|  |  |

| Always On | Fixed an issue where SSMS was throwing an error when trying to delete an Availability Group (AG) |
| Always On | Fixed an issue where SSMS was presenting the wrong failover wizard when replicas are configured as Synchronous when using read scale AGs (cluster type=NONE). Now, SSMS presents the wizard for Force_Failover_Allow_Data_Loss option, which is the only one allowed for cluster-type NONE Availability |
| Always On | Fixed an issue where the wizard was restricting the number of allowed synchronizations to three |
| Data Classification | Fixed an issue where SSMS was throwing an *Index (zero-based) must be greater than or equal to zero* error when trying to view data classification reports on databases with CompatLevel less than 150. |

| Object Explorer | Fixed a long outstanding issue where trying to expand the *Tables* node in Object Explorer for a database, which is set to use a collation that isn't supported by Windows anymore triggers an error (and the user can't expand their tables). An example of such collation would be Korean_Wansung_Unicode_CI_AS. |
| [Register Servers](register-servers/register-servers.md) | Fixed an issue where trying to issue a query against multiple servers (under a *Group* in Registered Servers) when the Registered Server uses either *Active Directory - Integrated* or *Azure Active Directory - Universal with MFA* didn't work because SSMS failed to connect. |
| [Register Servers](register-servers/register-servers.md) | Fixed an issue where trying to issue a query against multiple servers (under a *Group* in Registered Servers) when the registered server uses either *Active Directory - Password* or *SQL Auth* and the user chose not to remember the password would cause SSMS to crash. |
| Reports | Fixed an issue in *Disk Usage* reports where the report was failing to when data files had a vast number of extents. |

| SMO/Scripting | Last-page insert: SMO - Add property *Index.IsOptimizedForSequentialKey* |
|**SSMS Setup**| **Mitigated an issue where SSMS setup was incorrectly blocking the installation of SSMS reporting mismatching languages. This could have been an issue in some abnormal situations, like an aborted setup or an incorrect uninstall of a previous version of SSMS. See [UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035/suggestions/37483594/) for more details.** |
| XEvent Profiler | Fixed a crash when the viewer is being closed. |

#### What's new in 18.0

| New item| Details|
| :-------| :------|
|Support for SQL Server 2019|SSMS 18.0 is the first release that is fully *aware* of SQL Server 2019 (compatLevel 150).|
|Support for SQL Server 2019|Support for "BATCH_STARTED_GROUP" and "BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP" in SQL Server 2019 and SQL managed instance.|
|Support for SQL Server 2019|SMO: Added support for UDF Inlining.|
|Support for SQL Server 2019|GraphDB: Add a flag in showplan for Graph TC Sequence.|
|Support for SQL Server 2019|Always Encrypted: added support for AEv2 / Enclave.|
|Support for SQL Server 2019|Always Encrypted: connection dialog has a new tab "Always Encrypted" when the user clicks on the "Options" button to enable/configure Enclave support.|
|Smaller SSMS download size| The current size is ~500 MB, approximately half of the SSMS 17.x bundle.
|SSMS is based on the Visual Studio 2017 Isolated Shell|The new shell (SSMS is based on Visual Studio 2017 15.9.11) unlocks all the accessibility fixes that went into both SSMS and Visual Studio, and includes the latest security fixes.|
|SSMS accessibility improvements| Much work went in to address accessibility issues in all the tools (SSMS, DTA, and Profiler)|
|SSMS can now be installed in a custom folder| This option is available from both the command line (useful for unattended installation) and the setup UI. From the command line, pass this extra argument to the SSMS-Setup-ENU.exe:   SSMSInstallRoot=C:\MySSMS18  By default, the new install location for SSMS is: %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18\Common7\IDE\ssms.exe.  This does not mean that SSMS is multi-instance.|
|SSMS allows installing in a language other than the OS language|The block on mixed languages setup has been lifted. You can, for example, install SSMS German on a French Windows. If the OS language does not match the SSMS language, the user needs to change the language under **Tools** > **Options** > **International Settings**, otherwise SSMS shows the English UI.|
|SSMS no longer shares components with the SQL Engine|Much effort went in to avoid sharing components with SQL Engine, which often resulted in serviceability issues (one clobbering the files installed by the other).|
|SSMS requires NetFx 4.7.2 or greater|We upgraded our minimum requirement from NetFx4.6.1 to NetFx4.7.2: this allows us to take advantage of the new functionality exposed by the new framework.|
|Ability to migrate SSMS settings| When SSMS 18 is started for the first time, the user is prompted to migrate the 17.x settings. The user setting files are now stored as a plain XML file, thus improving portability and possibly allowing editing.|
|Support for High DPI| High DPI is now enabled by default.|
|SSMS ships with the Microsoft OLE DB driver| For details, see [Download Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/connect/oledb/download-oledb-driver-for-sql-server).|
|SSMS isn't supported on Windows 8. Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 require version 1607 (10.0.14393) or later|Due to the new dependency on NetFx 4.7.2, SSMS 18.0 does not install on Windows 8 and older versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. SSMS setup blocks those systems. Windows 8.1 is still supported.|
|SSMS is no longer added to the PATH environment variable|Path to SSMS.EXE (and tools in general) isn't added to the path anymore. Users can either manually add it, or if on a modern Windows computer, use on the Start menu.|
|Package IDs are no longer needed to develop SSMS Extensions| In the past, SSMS was selectively loading only well-known packages, thus requiring developers to register their own package. This is no longer the case.|
|General SSMS|Exposing AUTOGROW_ALL_FILES config option for Filegroups in SSMS.|
|General SSMS|Removed risky 'lightweight pooling' and 'priority boost' options from SSMS GUI. For details, see [Priority boost details – and why it’s not recommended](https://deep.data.blog/2010/01/26/priority-boost-details-and-why-its-not-recommended/).
|General SSMS|New menu and key bindings to creates files: **CTRL+ALT+N**. **CTRL+N** continues to create a new query.|
|General SSMS|**New Firewall Rule** dialog now allows the user to specify a rule name, instead of automatically generating one on behalf of the user.|
|General SSMS|Improved IntelliSense in Editor especially for v140+ T-SQL.|
|General SSMS|Added support in SSMS UI for UTF-8 on collation dialog.|
|General SSMS|Switched to "Windows Credential Manager" for connection dialog MRU passwords. This addresses a long outstanding issue where persistence of passwords wasn't always reliable.|
|General SSMS|Improved support for multi-monitor systems by making sure that more and more dialogs and windows pop up on the expected monitor.|
|General SSMS|Exposed the 'backup checksum default' server configuration in the new Database Settings page of the Server Properties Dialog. For details, see [https://feedback.azure.com/forums/08035-sql-server/suggestions/34634974](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/08035-sql-server/suggestions/34634974).|
|General SSMS|Exposed "maximum size for error log files" under "Configure SQL Server Error Logs". For details, see  [https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035/suggestions/33624115](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/908035/suggestions/33624115).|
|General SSMS|Added "Migrate to Azure" under Tools menu – We have integrated Database Migration Assistant and Azure Database Migration Service to provide quick and easy access to help accelerate your migrations to Azure.|
|General SSMS|Added logic to prompt the user to commit open transactions when "Change connection" is used.|

See the updated documentation at [https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/monitor-performance-for-always-on-availability-groups](../database-engine/availability-groups/windows/monitor-performance-for-always-on-availability-groups.md).|
|Always Encrypted| The Enable Always Encrypted checkbox in the new Always Encrypted tab in the Connect to Server dialog now provides an easy way to enable/disable Always Encrypted for a database connection.|
|Always Encrypted with secure enclaves| Several enhancements have been made to support  Always Encrypted with secure enclaves in SQL Server 2019:  A text field for specifying enclave attestation URL in the Connect to Server dialog (the new Always Encrypted tab).  The new checkbox in the New Column Master Key dialog to control whether a new column master key allows enclave computations.  Other Always Encrypted key management dialogs now expose the information on which column master keys allow enclave computations.|
|Audit Files|Changed authentication method from Storage Account Key based to Azure AD-based authentication.|
|Data Classification| Reorganized data classification task menu: added sub menu to the database tasks menu and added an option to open the report from the menu without opening the classify data window first.|
|Data Classification|Added new feature 'Data classification' to SMO. Column object exposes new properties: SensitivityLabelName, SensitivityLabelId, SensitivityInformationTypeName, SensitivityInformationTypeId, and IsClassified (read-only). For more information, see [ADD SENSITIVITY CLASSIFICATION (Transact-SQL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/add-sensitivity-classification-transact-sql)|
|Data Classification|Added new "Classification Report" menu item to the "Data Classification" flyout.|
|Data Classification| Updated recommendations.|
|Database Compatibility Level Upgrade|Added a new option under ***Database name*** > ***Tasks*** > ***Database Upgrade***. This starts the new **Query Tuning Assistant (QTA)** to guide the user through the process of: Collecting a performance baseline before upgrading the database compatibility level. Upgrading to the desired database compatibility level.  Collecting a second pass of performance data over the same workload. Detect workload regressions, and provide tested recommendations to improve workload performance.  This is close to the database upgrade process documented in [query store usage scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/performance/query-store-usage-scenarios#CEUpgrade), except for the last step where QTA does not rely on a previously known good state to generate recommendations.|
|Data-tier Application Wizard|Added support to Import/Export data-tier application with graph tables.|
|Flat File Import Wizard|Added logic to notify the user that an import may have resulted in a renaming of the columns.|
|Integration Services (SSIS)|Added support to allow customers to schedule SSIS packages on Azure-SSIS IRs that are in Azure Government cloud.|

#### Uninstall and reinstall SSMS 17.x

If your SSMS installation is having problems, and a standard uninstall and reinstall doesn't resolve them, you can first try [repairing](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028054/windows-10-repair-or-remove-programs) the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell. If repairing the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell doesn't resolve the problem, the following steps have been found to fix many random issues:

1. Uninstall SSMS the same way you uninstall any application (using *Apps & features*, *Programs, and features*, depending on your version of Windows).

2. Uninstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:

    ```PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"```

    ```vs_isoshell.exe /Uninstall /Force /PromptRestart```

3. Uninstall Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable the same way you uninstall any application. Uninstall both x86 and x64 if they're on your computer.

4. Reinstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:  

    ```PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"```  

    ```vs_isoshell.exe /PromptRestart```

5. Reinstall SSMS.
