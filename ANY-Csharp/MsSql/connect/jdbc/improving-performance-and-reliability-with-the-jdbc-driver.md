# Improving performance and reliability with the JDBC driver

[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

One aspect of application development that is common to all applications is the constant need to improve performance and reliability. There are a number of techniques for doing this with the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)].  
  
The topics in this section describe various techniques for improving application performance and reliability when using the JDBC driver.  

## In this section

|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Closing objects when not in use](../../connect/jdbc/closing-objects-when-not-in-use.md)|Describes the importance of closing JDBC driver objects when they are no longer needed.|  
|[Managing transaction size](../../connect/jdbc/managing-transaction-size.md)|Describes techniques for improving transaction performance.|  
|[Working with statements and result sets](../../connect/jdbc/working-with-statements-and-result-sets.md)|Describes techniques for improving performance when using the Statement or ResultSet objects.|  
|[Using adaptive buffering](../../connect/jdbc/using-adaptive-buffering.md)|Describes an adaptive buffering feature, which is designed to retrieve any kind of large-value data without the overhead of server cursors.|  
|[Sparse columns](../../connect/jdbc/sparse-columns.md)|Discusses the JDBC driver's support for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] sparse columns.|  
|[Prepared statement metadata caching for the JDBC driver](../../connect/jdbc/prepared-statement-metadata-caching-for-the-jdbc-driver.md)|Discusses the techniques for improving performance with prepared statement queries.|
|[Using bulk copy API for batch insert operation](../../connect/jdbc/use-bulk-copy-api-batch-insert-operation.md)|Describes how to enable Bulk Copy API for batch insert operations and its benefits.|
