# Using Always Encrypted with the secure enclaves
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

This page provides information on how to develop Java applications using [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves.md) and the Microsoft JDBC Driver 8.2 (or higher) for SQL Server.

Secure enclaves is an addition to the existing [Always Encrypted](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-database-engine.md) feature. The purpose of secure enclaves is to address limitations when working with Always Encrypted data. Previously, users could only perform equality comparisons on Always Encrypted data, and had to retrieve and decrypt the data in order to perform other operations. Secure enclaves address this limitation by allowing computations on plaintext data inside a secure enclave on the server side. A secure enclave is a protected region of memory within the SQL Server process, and acts as a trusted execution environment for processing sensitive data inside the SQL Server engine. A secure enclave appears as a black box to the rest of the SQL Server and other processes on the hosting machine. There is no way to view any data or code inside the enclave from the outside, even with a debugger.

## Prerequisites
- Make sure Microsoft JDBC Driver 8.2 (or higher) for SQL Server is installed on your development machine. 

> [!Note]
> If you are using an older version of JDK 8, you may need to download and install the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files. Be sure to read the Readme included in the zip file for installation instructions and relevant details on possible export/import issues.  
>
> The policy files can be downloaded from  [Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 8 Download](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html)

## Setting up secure enclaves
Follow this [tutorial](../../relational-databases/security/tutorial-getting-started-with-always-encrypted-enclaves.md) to get started with secure enclaves. For more in-depth information, refer to [Always encrypted with secure enclaves](../../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves.md).

## Connection String properties
**enclaveAttestationUrl:** the endpoint URL of the attestation service.

**enclaveAttestationProtocol:** the protocol of the attestation service. Currently, the only supported value is **HGS**(Host Guardian Service).

Users must enable **columnEncryptionSetting** and correctly set **both** of the above connection string properties in order to enable Always Encrypted with secure enclaves from the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)].

## Working with secure enclaves
When the enclave connection properties are set properly, the feature will work transparently. The driver will determine whether the query requires the use of a secure enclave automatically. The following are examples of queries which trigger enclave computations. You can find the database and table setup at [getting started with always encrypted enclaves](../../relational-databases/security/tutorial-getting-started-with-always-encrypted-enclaves.md).

Rich queries will trigger enclave computations:
```java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:sqlserver://<server>:<port>;user=<username>;password=<password>;databaseName=ContosoHR;columnEncryptionSetting=enabled;enclaveAttestationUrl=<attestation-url>;enclaveAttestationProtocol=<attestation-protocol>;";
try (Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection(URL)) {
	try (PreparedStatement p = c.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE SSN LIKE ?")) {
		p.setString(1, "%6818");
		try (ResultSet rs = p.executeQuery()) {
			while (rs.next()) {
				// Do work with data
			}
		}
	}
	
	try (PreparedStatement p = c.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE SALARY > ?")) {
		((SQLServerPreparedStatement) p).setMoney(1, new BigDecimal(0));
		try (ResultSet rs = p.executeQuery()) {
			while (rs.next()) {
				// Do work with data
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Toggling encryption on a column will also trigger enclave computations:
```java
private static final String URL = "jdbc:sqlserver://<server>:<port>;user=<username>;password=<password>;databaseName=ContosoHR;columnEncryptionSetting=enabled;enclaveAttestationUrl=<attestation-url>;enclaveAttestationProtocol=<attestation-protocol>;";
try (Connection c = DriverManager.getConnection(URL);Statement s = c.createStatement()) {
	s.executeUpdate("ALTER TABLE Employees ALTER COLUMN SSN CHAR(11) NULL WITH (ONLINE = ON)");
}
```

## Java 8 users
This feature requires the RSASSA-PSA signature algorithm. This algorithm was added in JDK 11, but not back-ported to JDK 8. Users who wish to use this feature with the JDK 8 version of the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] must either load their own provider, which supports the RSASSA-PSA signature algorithm, or include the BouncyCastleProvider optional dependency. The dependency will be removed at a later date if JDK 8 backports the signature algorithm or if the support lifecycle of JDK 8 ends.
