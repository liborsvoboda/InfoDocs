# Performing transactions with the JDBC driver
[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

  Transaction processing is a mandatory requirement of all applications that must guarantee consistency of their persistent data. With the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)], transaction processing can either be performed locally or distributed. Transactions are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) modules of execution.  
  
 The topics in this section describe how the JDBC driver supports transactions including isolation levels, transaction savepoints, and result set holdability.
