# Securing JDBC driver applications

[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

Enhancing the security of a [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../../includes/jdbcnoversion_md.md)] application involves more than avoiding common coding pitfalls. An application that accesses data has many potential points of failure that an attacker can exploit to retrieve, manipulate, or destroy sensitive data. It is important to understand all aspects of security, from the process of threat modeling during the design phase of your application to its eventual deployment, and continuing through its ongoing maintenance.  
  
The topics in this section describe some common security concerns including connection strings, validating user input, and general application security.
