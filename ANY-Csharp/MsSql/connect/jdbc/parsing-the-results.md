# Parsing the results

[!INCLUDE[Driver_JDBC_Download](../../includes/driver_jdbc_download.md)]

This article describes how SQL Server expects users to fully process results returned from any query.

## Update counts and result sets

This section will talk about the two most common results returned from SQL Server: Update Count and ResultSet. In general, any query a user executes will cause one of these results to be returned; users are expected to handle both when processing results.

The following code is an example of how a user could iterate through all results from the server:
```java
try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(URL); Statement statement = connection.createStatement()) {
	boolean resultsAvailable = statement.execute(USER_SQL);
	int updateCount = -2;
	while (true) {
		updateCount = statement.getUpdateCount();
		if (!resultsAvailable && updateCount == -1)
			break;
		if (resultsAvailable) {
			// handle ResultSet
		} else {
			// handle Update Count
		}
		resultsAvailable = statement.getMoreResults();
	}
}
```

## Exceptions
When you execute a statement that results in an error or an informational message, SQL Server will respond differently depending on whether it can generate an execution plan. The error message can be thrown immediately after statement execution or it might require a separate result set. In the latter case, the applications need to parse the result set to retrieve the exception.

When SQL Server is unable to generate an execution plan, the exception is thrown immediately.

```java
String SQL = "SELECT * FROM nonexistentTable;";
try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement();) {
    statement.execute(SQL);
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

When SQL Server returns an error message in a result set, the result set needs to be processed to retrieve the exception.

```java
String SQL = "SELECT 1/0;";
try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement();) {
    boolean hasResult = statement.execute(SQL);
    if (hasResult) {
        try (ResultSet rs = statement.getResultSet()) {
            // Exception is thrown on next().
            while (rs.next()) {}
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

If statement execution generates multiple result sets, each result set needs to be processed until the one with the exception is reached.

```java
String SQL = "SELECT 1; SELECT * FROM nonexistentTable;";
try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement();) {
    // Does not throw an exception on execute().
    boolean hasResult = statement.execute(SQL);
    while (hasResult) {
        try (ResultSet rs = statement.getResultSet()) {
            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println(rs.getString(1));
            }
        }
        // Moves the next result set that generates the exception.
        hasResult = statement.getMoreResults();
    }
} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In the case of `String SQL = "SELECT * FROM nonexistentTable; SELECT 1;";`, exception is thrown immediately on `execute()` and `SELECT 1` isn't executed at all.

If the error from SQL Server has severity of `0` to `9`, it's considered as an informational message and returned as `SQLWarning`.

```java
String SQL = "RAISERROR ('WarningLevel5', 5, 2);";
try (Statement statement = connection.createStatement();) {
    boolean hasResult = statement.execute(SQL);
    SQLWarning warning = statement.getWarnings();
    System.out.println(warning);
}
```
