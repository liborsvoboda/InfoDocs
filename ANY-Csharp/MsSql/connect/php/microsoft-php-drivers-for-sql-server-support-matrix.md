# Microsoft PHP Drivers for SQL Server Support Matrix

[!INCLUDE[Driver_PHP_Download](../../includes/driver_php_download.md)]

This page contains the support matrix and support lifecycle policy for the Microsoft PHP Drivers for SQL Server.

## Microsoft PHP Drivers Support Lifecycle Matrix and Policy

The Microsoft Support Lifecycle (MSL) policy provides transparent, predictable information regarding the support lifecycle of Microsoft products. PHP Drivers versions 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x have five years of Mainstream support from the driver release date. Mainstream support is defined on the [Microsoft support lifecycle website](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle).

Extended and custom support options are not available for the Microsoft PHP Drivers.

The following Microsoft PHP Drivers are supported, until the indicated End of Support date.

|Driver Name|Driver Package Version|End of Mainstream Support|
|-|:-:|-|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 5.8 for SQL Server|5.8|January 31, 2025|
|Microsoft PHP Drivers 5.6 for SQL Server|5.6|February 21, 2024|

## SQL Server Version Certified Compatibility
 The following matrix lists SQL Server versions that have been tested and certified as compatible with the corresponding driver version. We strive to maintain backward compatibility with previous driver versions, but only the latest supported driver is tested and certified with new SQL Server versions as SQL Server is released.
