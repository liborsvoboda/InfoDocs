# Tutorial: Develop a .NET application using Always Encrypted with secure enclaves

[!INCLUDE [tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-winonly](../../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-winonly.md)]

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-netfx-netcore-xxxx-md](../../../includes/appliesto-netfx-netcore-xxxx-md.md)]

This tutorial teaches you how to develop a simple application that issues database queries that use a server-side secure enclave for [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](../../../relational-databases/security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves.md).

## Prerequisites

This tutorial is the continuation of [Tutorial: Getting Started with Always Encrypted with secure enclaves using SSMS](../../../relational-databases/security/tutorial-getting-started-with-always-encrypted-enclaves.md). Make sure you've completed it before following the below steps.

In addition, you need Visual Studio (version 2019 is recommended) - you can download it from [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com). Your application development environment must use .NET Framework 4.6 or later or .NET Core 2.1 or later.

## Step 1: Set up your Visual Studio Project

To use Always Encrypted with secure enclaves in a .NET Framework application, you need to make sure your application targets .NET Framework 4.6 or higher. To use Always Encrypted with secure enclaves in a .NET Core application, you need to make sure your application targets .NET Core 2.1 or higher.

In addition, if you store your column master key in Azure Key Vault, you also need to integrate your application with the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider).

1. Open Visual Studio.

2. Create a new C\# Console App (.NET Framework / Core) project.

3. Make sure your project targets at least .NET Framework 4.6 or .NET Core 2.1. Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer, select Properties and set the Target framework.

4. Install the following NuGet package by going to **Tools** (main menu) > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**. Run the following code in the Package Manager Console.

   ```powershell
   Install-Package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient -Version 1.1.0
   ```

5. If you use Azure Key Vault for storing your column master keys, install the following NuGet packages by going to **Tools** (main menu) > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**. Run the following code in the Package Manager Console.

   ```powershell
   Install-Package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider -Version 1.0.0
   Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory
   ```

6. Specify the `Attestation Protocol` and the `Enclave Attestation Url` in the connection string, which will be used in your application to communicate with the SQL Server.

  ```cs
   Attestation Protocol = HGS; Enclave Attestation Url = http://hgs.bastion.local/Attestation; Column Encryption Setting = Enabled
   ```

## Step 2: Implement your application logic

Your application will connect to the **ContosoHR** database from the [Tutorial: Getting started with Always Encrypted with secure enclaves using SSMS](../../../relational-databases/security/tutorial-getting-started-with-always-encrypted-enclaves.md) and it will run a query that contains the `LIKE` predicate on the **SSN** column and a range comparison on the **Salary** column.

1. Replace the content of the Program.cs file (generated by Visual Studio) with the following code. Update the database connection string with your server name and the enclave attestation URL for your environment. You may also update database authentication settings.

    ```cs
    using System;
    using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;
    using System.Data;

    namespace ConsoleApp1
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {

                string connectionString = "Data Source = myserver; Initial Catalog = ContosoHR; Column Encryption Setting = Enabled;Attestation Protocol = HGS; Enclave Attestation Url = http://hgs.bastion.local/Attestation; Integrated Security = true";

                using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
                {
                    connection.Open();

                    SqlCommand cmd = connection.CreateCommand();
                    cmd.CommandText = @"SELECT [SSN], [FirstName], [LastName], [Salary] FROM [dbo].[Employees] WHERE [SSN] LIKE @SSNPattern AND [Salary] > @MinSalary;";

                    SqlParameter paramSSNPattern = cmd.CreateParameter();

                    paramSSNPattern.ParameterName = @"@SSNPattern";
                    paramSSNPattern.DbType = DbType.AnsiStringFixedLength;
                    paramSSNPattern.Direction = ParameterDirection.Input;
                    paramSSNPattern.Value = "%1111";
                    paramSSNPattern.Size = 11;

                    cmd.Parameters.Add(paramSSNPattern);

                    SqlParameter MinSalary = cmd.CreateParameter();

                    MinSalary.ParameterName = @"@MinSalary";
                    MinSalary.DbType = DbType.Currency;
                    MinSalary.Direction = ParameterDirection.Input;
                    MinSalary.Value = 900;

                    cmd.Parameters.Add(MinSalary);
                    cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();

                    SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();
                    while (reader.Read())

                    {
                        Console.WriteLine(reader);
                        Console.WriteLine(reader[0] + ", " + reader[1] + ", " + reader[2] + ", " + reader[3]);
                    }
                    Console.ReadKey();
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. Build and run the application.
