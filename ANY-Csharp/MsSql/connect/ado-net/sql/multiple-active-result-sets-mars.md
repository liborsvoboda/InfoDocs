# Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS)

[!INCLUDE[Driver_ADONET_Download](../../../includes/driver_adonet_download.md)]

Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS) is a feature that allows the execution of multiple batches on a single connection. In previous versions, only one batch could be executed at a time against a single connection. Executing multiple batches with MARS does not imply simultaneous execution of operations.
