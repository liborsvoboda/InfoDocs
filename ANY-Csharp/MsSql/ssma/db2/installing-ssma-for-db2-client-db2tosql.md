# Installing SSMA for DB2 Client (DB2ToSQL)

The SSMA client consists of the program files that perform the following tasks:  
  
- Connect to a DB2 database.  
  
- Connect to an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
- Convert DB2 database objects to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] syntax.  
  
- Load the objects into [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
- Migrate data to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
This topic provides the installation prerequisites and instructions for installing SSMA.  
  
## Prerequisites

SSMA is designed to work with DB2 on z/OS version 9.0 and 10.0 or DB2 on LUW version 9.8 and 10.1 or later versions and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] 2012 or later versions.  
  
Before you install SSMA, make sure that the computer meets the following requirements:  
  
- Windows 7 or later versions, or Windows Server 2008 or later versions.  
  
- [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] Windows Installer 3.1 or later versions.  
  
- The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] version 4.0 or a later version. The [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../../includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] version 4.0 is available on the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] product media. You can also obtain it from the [.NET Framework Developer Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=48882).  
  
- Microsoft OLEDB Provider for DB2 version 5 or a later version, and connectivity to the DB2 databases that you want to migrate.  
  
- Access to and sufficient permissions on the computer that hosts the target instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL DB where you will be migrating database objects and data. For more information, see [Connecting to SQL Server &#40;DB2eToSQL&#41;](../../ssma/db2/connecting-to-sql-server-db2etosql.md).  
  
- 4 GB RAM recommended.  
  
## Microsoft OLEDB Provider for DB2  

To download the OLEDB provider for DB2 version 6.0, go to [Microsoft® SQL Server® 2017 Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=55992).

SSMA is a Web download. To download the latest version, see the [SQL Server Migration Assistant download page](https://aka.ms/ssmafordb2).  
  
After you download the latest version, extract the installation files so you can install SSMA.

1. Double-click SSMA for DB2 *n*.Install.exe, where *n* is the build number.  
  
2. On the **Welcome** page, select **Next**.  
  
   If you don't have the prerequisites installed, a message will appear indicating that you must first install required components. Make sure that you've installed all prerequisites, and then run the installation program again.  
  
3. Read the End User License Agreement. If you agree, select **I accept the terms in the license agreement**, and then select **Next**.
