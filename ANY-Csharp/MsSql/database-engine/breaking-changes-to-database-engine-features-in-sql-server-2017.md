# Breaking Changes to Database Engine Features in [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2017-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2017-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]


  This topic describes breaking changes in the [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)]. These changes might break applications, scripts, or functionalities that are based on earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. You might encounter these issues when you upgrade.  
  
## Breaking Changes in [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)]  
  
-  CLR uses Code Access Security (CAS) in the .NET Framework, which is no longer supported as a security boundary. Beginning with [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssDE](../includes/ssde-md.md)], an `sp_configure` option called `clr strict security` is introduced to enhance the security of CLR assemblies. clr strict security is enabled by default, and treats `SAFE` and `EXTERNAL_ACCESS` CLR assemblies as if they were marked `UNSAFE`. The `clr strict security` option can be disabled for backward compatibility, but this is not recommended. When `clr strict security` is disabled, a CLR assembly created with `PERMISSION_SET = SAFE` may be able to access external system resources, call unmanaged code, and acquire **sysadmin** privileges. After enabling strict security, any assemblies that are not signed will fail to load. Also, if a database has `SAFE` or `EXTERNAL_ACCESS` assemblies, `RESTORE` or `ATTACH DATABASE` statements can complete, but the assemblies may fail to load.   
  To load the assemblies, you must either alter or drop and recreate each assembly so that it is signed with a certificate or asymmetric key that has a corresponding login with the `UNSAFE ASSEMBLY` permission on the server. For more information, see [CLR strict security](../database-engine/configure-windows/clr-strict-security.md). 
  
-  The MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA, and SHA1 algorithms are deprecated in [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../includes/sssql15-md.md)]. Up to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../includes/sssql15-md.md)], a self-signed certificate is created using SHA1. Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../includes/sssql17-md.md)], a self-signed certificate is created using SHA2_256.
