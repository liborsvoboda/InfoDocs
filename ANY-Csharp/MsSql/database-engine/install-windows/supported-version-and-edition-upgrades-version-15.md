# Supported version & edition upgrades (SQL Server 2019)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]
  
  You can upgrade from [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[sssql17-md](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)]. This article lists the supported upgrade paths from these [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] versions, and the supported edition upgrades for [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)].  
  
## Pre upgrade Checklist  

- Before upgrading from one edition of [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] to another, verify that the functionality you are currently using is supported in the edition to which you are moving.  
- Verify supported [hardware and software](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server-ver15.md).
- Before upgrading [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], enable Windows Authentication for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent and verify the default configuration: that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Agent service account is a member of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] sysadmin group.
- To upgrade to [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)], you must be running a supported operating system. For more information, see [Hardware and Software Requirements for Installing SQL Server](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server-ver15.md).  
- Upgrade will be blocked if there is a pending restart.  
- Upgrade will be blocked if the Windows Installer service is not running.

## Unsupported Scenarios

- Cross-version instances of [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] are not supported. Version numbers of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] components must be the same in an instance of [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)].  
  
- [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] is only available for 64-bit platforms. Cross-platform upgrade is not supported. You cannot upgrade a 32-bit instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to native 64-bit using [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup. However, you can back up or detach databases from a 32-bit instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and then restore or attach them to a new instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (64-bit) if the databases are not published in replication. You must re-create any logins and other user objects in master, msdb, and model system databases.  
  
- You cannot add new features during the upgrade of your existing instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. After you upgrade an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)], you can add features by using the [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] Setup. For more information, see [Add Features to an Instance of SQL Server &#40;Setup&#41;](../../database-engine/install-windows/add-features-to-an-instance-of-sql-server-2016-setup.md).  
 
## Upgrades from Earlier Versions to [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]  
 
[!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] supports upgrade from the following versions of SQL Server:

- [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] SP4 or later
- [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] SP3 or later
- [!INCLUDE[ssSQL16](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)] SP2 or later
- [!INCLUDE[sssqlv14-md](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)]

The table below lists the supported upgrade scenarios from earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)].

## Migrate to SQL Server 2019

You can migrate databases from older versions. For example, you can migrate databases from [!INCLUDE [sskilimanjaro-md](../../includes/sskilimanjaro-md.md)] to SQL Server 2019.

For information, see [Azure Database Migration Guide](https://datamigration.microsoft.com/scenario/sql-to-sqlserver).

The following tips and tools can help you plan and implement your migration.

- Migration tools: Migration is supported through [Data Migration Assistant (DMA)](https://aka.ms/dma).
- Backup and restore: A backup taken on SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2008 R2 can be restored to SQL Server 2019.
- Log shipping: Log shipping is supported if primary is running SQL Server 2008 SP3 or later, or SQL Server 2008 R2 SP2 or later, and secondary is running SQL Server 2019. 

   > [!WARNING]
   > If an automatic or manual failover happens and the SQL Server 2019 instance becomes primary, SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2008 R2 instance becomes secondary and cannot receive changes from primary.

- Bulk load: Tables can be bulk copied from SQL Server 2008 or SQL Server 2008 R2 to SQL Server 2019.

## [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] Edition Upgrade 

The following table lists the supported edition upgrade scenarios in [!INCLUDE[sssqlv15-md](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)].  

For step-by-step instructions on how to perform an edition upgrade, see [Upgrade to a Different Edition of SQL Server &#40;Setup&#41;](../../database-engine/install-windows/upgrade-to-a-different-edition-of-sql-server-setup.md).
