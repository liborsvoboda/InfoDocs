# SQL Server installation guide

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md-winonly.md)]

This article is an index of content that provides guidance for installing SQL Server on Windows.

For other deployment scenarios, see:

- [Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup.md)
- [Docker containers](../../linux/sql-server-linux-configure-docker.md)
- [Kubernetes - Big Data Clusters](../../big-data-cluster/deploy-get-started.md)

Beginning with [!INCLUDE[sssql15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is only available as a 64-bit application. Here are important details about how to get SQL Server and how to install it.

## Getting started
  
* **Editions and features**: Review the supported features for the different editions and versions of SQL Server to determine which best suits your business needs. 
    - [[!INCLUDE[ss2019](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]](~/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-version-15.md).  
    - [[!INCLUDE[ss2017](../../includes/sssqlv14-md.md)]](~/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2017.md).  
    - [[!INCLUDE[ss2016](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)]](~/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2016.md).  
    - [[!INCLUDE[ss2014](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)]](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc645993(v=sql.120).aspx)

*  **Requirements**: Review hardware and software installation requirements for [SQL Server 2016 & 2017](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md), [SQL Server 2019](../../sql-server/install/hardware-and-software-requirements-for-installing-sql-server.md) or [SQL Server on Linux](../../linux/sql-server-linux-setup.md), as well as system configuration checks, and security considerations in [Planning a SQL Server Installation](../../sql-server/install/planning-a-sql-server-installation.md) 


  
* **Sample databases and sample code**: 
    * They are not installed as part of SQL Server setup by default but can be found 
    * To install them for non-Express editions of SQL Server, see the [Where are samples](../../samples/sql-samples-where-are.md)
    

## Installation media

The download location for [!INCLUDE[ssnoversion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] depends on the edition:

* **SQL Server Enterprise, Standard, and Express Editions** are licensed for production use. For the Enterprise and Standard Editions, contact your software vendor for the installation media. You can find purchasing information and a directory of Microsoft partners on the [Microsoft licensing page](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/sql-server).
* [Free version - latest](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
* [Free version - others](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server)


Other SQL Server components can be found here: 

* [All cumulative updates](https://sqlserverbuilds.blogspot.com/)
* [SQL Server Reporting Services](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=100122). 
* [SQL Server Management Studio](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup)
* [Azure Data Studio](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109256)


## Considerations

-   Installation fails if you launch setup through Remote Desktop Connection with the media on a local resource in the RDC client. To install remotely the media must be on a network share or local to the physical or virtual machine. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] installation media may be either on a network share, a mapped drive, a local drive, or presented as an ISO to a virtual machine.  
  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup installs the following software components required by the product:  
  
    -   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Native Client    
    -   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Setup support files
