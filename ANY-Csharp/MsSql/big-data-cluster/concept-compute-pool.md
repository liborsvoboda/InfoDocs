# What are compute pools in a SQL Server big data cluster?

[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx](../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx.md)]

This article describes the role of *SQL Server compute pools* in a SQL Server big data cluster. Compute pools provide scale-out computational resources for a big data cluster. The following sections describe the architecture and functionality of a compute pool.

You can also watch this 5-minute video for an introduction into compute pools:

## Compute pool architecture

A compute pool is made of one or more compute pods running in Kubernetes. The automated creation and management of these pods is coordinated by the [SQL Server master instance](concept-master-instance.md). Each pod contains a set of base services and an instance of the SQL Server database engine.

## Scale-out groups

A compute pool can act as a PolyBase scale-out group for distributed queries over different data sources--such as HDFS, Oracle, MongoDB, or Teradata. By using compute pods in Kubernetes, big data clusters can automate creating and configuring compute pods for PolyBase scale-out groups.
