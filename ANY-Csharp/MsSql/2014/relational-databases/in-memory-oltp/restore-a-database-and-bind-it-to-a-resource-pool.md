# Restore a Database and Bind it to a Resource Pool
  Even though you have enough memory to restore a database with memory-optimized tables, you want to follow best practices and bind the database to a named resource pool. Since the database must exist before you can bind it to the pool restoring your database is a multi-step process. This topic walks you through that process.  
  
##  Restore with NORECOVERY  
 When you restore a database, NORECOVERY causes the database to be created and the disk image restored without consuming memory.  
  
```sql  
RESTORE DATABASE IMOLTP_DB   
   FROM DISK = 'C:\IMOLTP_test\IMOLTP_DB.bak'  
   WITH NORECOVERY  
```  
  
##  Create the resource pool  
 The following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] creates a resource pool named Pool_IMOLTP with 50% of memory available for its use.  After the pool is created, the Resource Governor is reconfigured to include Pool_IMOLTP.  
  
```sql  
CREATE RESOURCE POOL Pool_IMOLTP WITH (MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = 50);  
ALTER RESOURCE GOVERNOR RECONFIGURE;  
GO  
```  
  
##  Bind the database and resource pool  
 Use the system function `sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool` to bind the database to the resource pool. The function takes two parameters: the database name followed by the resource pool name.  
  
 The following [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)] defines a binding of the database IMOLTP_DB to the resource pool Pool_IMOLTP. The binding does not become effective until you complete the next step.  
  
```sql  
EXEC sp_xtp_bind_db_resource_pool 'IMOLTP_DB', 'Pool_IMOLTP'  
GO  
```  
  
##  Restore with RECOVERY  
 When you restore the database with recovery the database is brought online and all the data restored.  
  
```sql  
RESTORE DATABASE IMOLTP_DB   
   WITH RECOVERY  
```  
  
##  Monitor the resource pool performance  
 Once the database is bound to the named resource pool and restored with recovery, monitor the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], Resource Pool Stats Object. For more information see [SQL Server, Resource Pool Stats Object](../performance-monitor/sql-server-resource-pool-stats-object.md).
