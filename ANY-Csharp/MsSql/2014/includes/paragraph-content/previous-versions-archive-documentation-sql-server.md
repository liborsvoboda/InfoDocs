We accumulate and retain documentation for very old versions of SQL Server in a set of archive webpages. The archived webpages are not processed by search engines, such as Bing.com and Google.com. But you can see these archives at our Docs _previous-versions/_ address:

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/sql/)

These archives include the documentation for at least the following older versions:

- SQL Server 2012
- SQL Server 2008 R2
- SQL Server 2008
- SQL Server 2005

[SQL Server 2014 documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/2014-toc/index?view=sql-server-2014) is still processed by search engines.

SQL Server 2016, and later versions, are documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/sql-server/index).
