## SQL Server and SQL Database managed instance

Creates a Resource Governor workload group and associates the workload group with a Resource Governor resource pool. Resource Governor is not available in every edition of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../../includes/msconame-md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. For a list of features that are supported by the editions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], see [Features Supported by the Editions of SQL Server 2016](~/sql-server/editions-and-supported-features-for-sql-server-2016.md).

## Syntax

```
CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP group_name
[ WITH
    ( [ IMPORTANCE = { LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH } ]
      [ [ , ] REQUEST_MAX_MEMORY_GRANT_PERCENT = value ]
      [ [ , ] REQUEST_MAX_CPU_TIME_SEC = value ]
      [ [ , ] REQUEST_MEMORY_GRANT_TIMEOUT_SEC = value ]
      [ [ , ] MAX_DOP = value ]
      [ [ , ] GROUP_MAX_REQUESTS = value ] )
 ]
[ USING {
    [ pool_name | "default" ]
    [ [ , ] EXTERNAL external_pool_name | "default" ] ]
    } ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

*group_name*</br>
Is the user-defined name for the workload group. *group_name* is alphanumeric, can be up to 128 characters, must be unique within an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and must comply with the rules for [identifiers](../../relational-databases/databases/database-identifiers.md).

IMPORTANCE = { LOW | **MEDIUM** | HIGH }</br>
Specifies the relative importance of a request in the workload group. Importance is one of the following, with MEDIUM being the default:

- LOW
- MEDIUM (default)
- HIGH

> [!NOTE]
> Internally each importance setting is stored as a number that is used for calculations.

IMPORTANCE is local to the resource pool; workload groups of different importance inside the same resource pool affect each other, but do not affect workload groups in another resource pool.

REQUEST_MAX_MEMORY_GRANT_PERCENT = *value*</br>
Specifies the maximum amount of memory that a single request can take from the pool. *value* is a percentage relative to the resource pool size specified by MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT.

*value* is an integer up to [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] and a float starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)] and in [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)] managed instance. Default value is 25. The allowed range for *value* is from 1 through 100.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The amount specified only refers to query execution grant memory.
>
> Setting *value* to 0 prevents queries with SORT and HASH JOIN operations in user-defined workload groups from running.
>
> It is not recommended to set *value* greater than 70 because the server may be unable to set aside enough free memory if other concurrent queries are running. This may eventually lead to query time-out error 8645.
>
> If the query memory requirements exceed the limit that is specified by this parameter, the server does the following:
>
> - For user-defined workload groups, the server tries to reduce the query degree of parallelism until the memory requirement falls under the limit, or until the degree of parallelism equals 1. If the query memory requirement is still greater than the limit, error 8657 occurs.
>
> - For internal and default workload groups, the server permits the query to obtain the required memory.
>
> Be aware that both cases are subject to time-out error 8645 if the server has insufficient physical memory.

REQUEST_MAX_CPU_TIME_SEC = *value*</br>
Specifies the maximum amount of CPU time, in seconds, that a request can use. *value* must be 0 or a positive integer. The default setting for *value* is 0, which means unlimited.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Resource Governor will not prevent a request from continuing if the maximum time is exceeded. However, an event will be generated. For more information, see [CPU Threshold Exceeded Event Class](../../relational-databases/event-classes/cpu-threshold-exceeded-event-class.md).
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP2 and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] CU3, and using [trace flag 2422](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md), Resource Governor will abort a request when the maximum time is exceeded.

REQUEST_MEMORY_GRANT_TIMEOUT_SEC = *value*</br>
Specifies the maximum time, in seconds, that a query can wait for a memory grant (work buffer memory) to become available. *value* must be 0 or a positive integer. The default setting for *value*, 0, uses an internal calculation based on query cost to determine the maximum time.

> [!NOTE]
> A query does not always fail when memory grant time-out is reached. A query will only fail if there are too many concurrent queries running. Otherwise, the query may only get the minimum memory grant, resulting in reduced query performance.

MAX_DOP = *value*</br>
Specifies the **maximum degree of parallelism (MAXDOP)** for parallel query execution. *value* must be 0 or a positive integer. The allowed range for *value* is from 0 through 64. The default setting for *value*, 0, uses the global setting. MAX_DOP is handled as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> Workload group MAX_DOP overrides the [server configuration for max degree of parallelism](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md) and the **MAXDOP** [database scoped configuration](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md).

> [!TIP]
> To accomplish this at the query level, use the **MAXDOP** [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md). Setting the maximum degree of parallelism as a query hint is effective as long as it does not exceed the workload group MAX_DOP. If the MAXDOP query hint value exceeds the value that is configured by using the Resource Governor, the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] uses the Resource Governor `MAX_DOP` value. The MAXDOP [query hint](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-query.md) always overrides the [server configuration for max degree of parallelism](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md).
>
> To accomplish this at the database level, use the **MAXDOP** [database scoped configuration](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md).
>
> To accomplish this at the server level, use the **max degree of parallelism (MAXDOP)** [server configuration option](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md).

GROUP_MAX_REQUESTS = *value*</br>
Specifies the maximum number of simultaneous requests that are allowed to execute in the workload group. *value* must be a 0 or a positive integer. The default setting for *value* is 0, and allows unlimited requests. When the maximum concurrent requests are reached, a user in that group can log in, but is placed in a wait state until concurrent requests are dropped below the value specified.

USING { *pool_name* | **"default"** }</br>
Associates the workload group with the user-defined resource pool identified by *pool_name*. This in effect puts the workload group in the resource pool. If *pool_name* is not provided, or if the USING argument is not used, the workload group is put in the predefined Resource Governor default pool.

"default" is a reserved word and when used with USING, must be enclosed by quotation marks ("") or brackets ([]).

> [!NOTE]
> Predefined workload groups and resource pools all use lower case names, such as "default". This should be taken into account for servers that use case-sensitive collation. Servers with case-insensitive collation, such as SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS, will treat "default" and "Default" as the same.

EXTERNAL external_pool_name | "default"</br>
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)]).

Workload group can specify an external resource pool. You can define a workload group and associate with two pools:

- A resource pool for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] workloads and queries
- An external resource pool for external processes. For more information, see [sp_execute_external_script &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md).

## Remarks

When `REQUEST_MEMORY_GRANT_PERCENT` is used, index creation is allowed to use more workspace memory than what is initially granted for improved performance. This special handling is supported by Resource Governor in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../includes/sscurrent-md.md)]. However, the initial grant and any additional memory grant are limited by resource pool and workload group settings.

The `MAX_DOP` limit is set per [task](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-tasks-transact-sql.md). It is not a per [request](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-requests-transact-sql.md) or per query limit. This means that during a parallel query execution, a single request can spawn multiple tasks which are assigned to a [scheduler](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-tasks-transact-sql.md). For more information, see the [Thread and Task Architecture Guide](../../relational-databases/thread-and-task-architecture-guide.md).

When `MAX_DOP` is used and a query is marked as serial at compile time, it cannot be changed back to parallel at run time regardless of the workload group or server configuration setting. After `MAX_DOP` is configured, it can only be lowered due to memory pressure. Workload group reconfiguration is not visible while waiting in the grant memory queue.

### Index Creation on a Partitioned Table

The memory consumed by index creation on non-aligned partitioned table is proportional to the number of partitions involved. If the total required memory exceeds the per-query limit `REQUEST_MAX_MEMORY_GRANT_PERCENT` imposed by the Resource Governor workload group setting, this index creation may fail to execute. Because the *"default"* workload group allows a query to exceed the per-query limit with the minimum required memory, the user may be able to run the same index creation in *"default"* workload group, if the *"default"* resource pool has enough total memory configured to run such query.

## Permissions

Requires `CONTROL SERVER` permission.

## Example

Create a workload group named `newReports` which uses the Resource Governor default settings, and is in the Resource Governor default pool. The example specifies the `default` pool, but this is not required.

```sql
CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP newReports
WITH
    (REQUEST_MAX_MEMORY_GRANT_PERCENT = 2.5
      , REQUEST_MAX_CPU_TIME_SEC = 100
      , MAX_DOP = 4)    
USING "default" ;
GO
```

## Azure Synapse Analytics (preview)

Creates a workload group. Workload groups are containers for a set of requests and are the basis for how workload management is configured on a system. Workload groups provide the ability to reserve resources for workload isolation, contain resources, define resources per request, and adhere to execution rules. Once the statement completes, the settings are in effect.

 ![Topic link icon](../../database-engine/configure-windows/media/topic-link.gif "Topic link icon") [Transact-SQL Syntax Conventions](../../t-sql/language-elements/transact-sql-syntax-conventions-transact-sql.md).

```
CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP group_name
[ WITH
 (  [ MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = value ]
  [ [ , ] CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = value ]
  [ [ , ] REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = value ]
  [ [ , ] REQUEST_MAX_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = value ]
  [ [ , ] IMPORTANCE = { LOW | BELOW_NORMAL | NORMAL | ABOVE_NORMAL | HIGH } ]
  [ [ , ] QUERY_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SEC = value ] )
  [ ; ]
]
```

*group_name*</br>
Specifies the name by which the workload group is identified. *group_name* is a sysname. It can be up to 128 characters long and must be unique within the instance.

*MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE* = value</br>
Specifies a guaranteed minimum resource allocation for this workload group that is not shared with other workload groups. *value* is an integer range from 0 to 100. The sum of min_percentage_resource across all workload groups cannot exceed 100. The value for min_percentage_resource cannot be greater than cap_percentage_resource. There are minimum effective values allowed per service level. See [Effective Values](#effective-values) for more details.

*CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE* = value</br>
Specifies the maximum resource utilization for all requests in a workload group. The allowed integer range for value is 1 through 100. The value for cap_percentage_resource must be greater than min_percentage_resource. The effective value for cap_percentage_resource can be reduced if min_percentage_resource is configured greater than zero in other workload groups.

*REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT* = value</br>
Sets the minimum amount of resources allocated per request. *value* is a required parameter with a decimal range between 0.75 to 100.00. The value for request_min_resource_grant_percent must be a multiple of 0.25, must be a factor of min_percentage_resource, and be less than cap_percentage_resource. There are minimum effective values allowed per service level. See [Effective Values](#effective-values) for more details.

For example:

```sql
CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP wgSample 
WITH
  ( MIN_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 26                -- integer value
    , REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT = 3.25 -- factor of 26 (guaranteed a minimum of 8 concurrency)
    , CAP_PERCENTAGE_RESOURCE = 100 )
```

Consider the values that are used for resource classes as a guideline for request_min_resource_grant_percent.  The table below contains resource allocations for Gen2.

|Resource Class|Percent of Resources|
|---|---|
|Smallrc|3%|
|Mediumrc|10%|
|Largerc|22%|
|Xlargerc|70%|
|||

*REQUEST_MAX_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT* = value</br>         
Sets the maximum amount of resources allocated per request. *value* is an optional decimal parameter with a default value equal to the request_min_resource_grant_percent. *value* must be greater than or equal to request_min_resource_grant_percent. When the value of request_max_resource_grant_percent is greater than request_min_resource_grant_percent and system resources are available, additional resources are allocated to a request.

*IMPORTANCE* = { LOW | BELOW_NORMAL | NORMAL | ABOVE_NORMAL | HIGH }</br>        
Specifies the default importance of a request for the workload group. Importance is one of the following, with NORMAL being the default:

- LOW
- BELOW_NORMAL
- NORMAL (default)
- ABOVE_NORMAL
- HIGH

Importance set at the workload group is a default importance for all requests in the workload group. A user can also set importance at the classifier level, which can override the workload group importance setting. This allows for differentiation of importance for requests within a workload group to get access to non-reserved resources quicker. When the sum of min_percentage_resource across workload groups is less than 100, there are non-reserved resources that are assigned on a basis of importance.

*QUERY_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SEC* = value</br>     
Specifies the maximum time, in seconds, that a query can execute before it is canceled. *value* must be 0 or a positive integer. The default setting for value is 0, which the query never times out. QUERY_EXECUTION_TIMEOUT_SEC counts once the query is in running state, not when the query is queued.

## Remarks

Workload groups corresponding to resource classes are created automatically for backward compatibility. These system defined workload groups cannot be dropped. An additional 8 user defined workload groups can be created.

If a workload group is created with `min_percentage_resource` greater than zero, the `CREATE WORKLOAD GROUP` statement will queue until there are enough resources to create the workload group.

## Effective Values

The parameters `min_percentage_resource`, `cap_percentage_resource`, `request_min_resource_grant_percent` and `request_max_resource_grant_percent` have effective values that are adjusted in the context of the current service level and the configuration of other workload groups.

The supported concurrency per service level remains the same as when resource classes were used to define resource grants per query, hence, the supported values for request_min_resource_grant_percent is dependent on the service level the instance is set to. At the lowest service level, DW100c, a minimum 25% resources per request is needed. At DW100c, the effective request_min_resource_grant_percent for a configured workload group can be 25% or higher. See the below table for further details on how effective values are derived.

|Service Level|Lowest effective value for REQUEST_MIN_RESOURCE_GRANT_PERCENT|Maximum concurrent queries|
|---|---|---|
|DW100c|25%|4|
|DW200c|12.5%|8|
|DW300c|8%|12|
|DW400c|6.25%|16|
|DW500c|5%|20|
|DW1000c|3%|32|
|DW1500c|3%|32|
|DW2000c|2%|48|
|DW2500c|2%|48|
|DW3000c|1.5%|64|
|DW5000c|1.5%|64|
|DW6000c|0.75%|128|
|DW7500c|0.75%|128|
|DW10000c|0.75%|128|
|DW15000c|0.75%|128|
|DW30000c|0.75%|128|
||||

Similarly, request_min_resource_grant_percent, min_percentage_resource must be greater than or equal to the effective request_min_resource_grant_percent. A workload group with `min_percentage_resource` configured that is less than effective `min_percentage_resource` has the value adjusted to zero at run time. When this happens, the resources configured for `min_percentage_resource` are sharable across all workload groups. For example, the workload group `wgAdHoc` with a `min_percentage_resource` of 10% running at DW1000c would have an effective `min_percentage_resource` of 10% (3.25% is the minimum supported value at DW1000c). `wgAdhoc` at DW100c would have an effective min_percentage_resource of 0%. The 10% configured for `wgAdhoc` would be shared across all workload groups.

`cap_percentage_resource` also has an effective value. If a workload group `wgAdhoc` is configured with a `cap_percentage_resource` of 100% and another workload group `wgDashboards` is created with 25% `min_percentage_resource`, the effective `cap_percentage_resource` for `wgAdhoc` becomes 75%.

The easiest way to understand the run-time values for your workload groups is to query the system view [sys.dm_workload_management_workload_groups_stats](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-workload-management-workload-group-stats-transact-sql.md).
