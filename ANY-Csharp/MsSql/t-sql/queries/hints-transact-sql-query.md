# Hints (Transact-SQL) - Query
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Query hints specify that the indicated hints should be used throughout the query. They affect all operators in the statement. If UNION is involved in the main query, only the last query involving a UNION operation can have the OPTION clause. Query hints are specified as part of the [OPTION clause](../../t-sql/queries/option-clause-transact-sql.md). Error 8622 occurs if one or more query hints cause the Query Optimizer not to generate a valid plan.  
  
> [!CAUTION]  
> Because the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Query Optimizer typically selects the best execution plan for a query, we recommend only using hints as a last resort for experienced developers and database administrators.

## Arguments  
{ HASH | ORDER } GROUP  
Specifies that aggregations that the query's GROUP BY or DISTINCT clause describes should use hashing or ordering.  
  
{ MERGE | HASH | CONCAT } UNION  
Specifies that all UNION operations are run by merging, hashing, or concatenating UNION sets. If more than one UNION hint is specified, the Query Optimizer selects the least expensive strategy from those hints specified.  
  
{ LOOP | MERGE | HASH } JOIN  
Specifies all join operations are performed by LOOP JOIN, MERGE JOIN, or HASH JOIN in the whole query. If you specify more than one join hint, the optimizer selects the least expensive join strategy from the allowed ones.  
  
If you specify a join hint in the same query's FROM clause for a specific table pair, this join hint takes precedence in the joining of the two tables. The query hints, though, must still be honored. The join hint for the pair of tables may only restrict the selection of allowed join methods in the query hint. For more information, see [Join Hints &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-join.md).  
  
EXPAND VIEWS  
Specifies the indexed views are expanded. Also specifies the Query Optimizer won't consider any indexed view as a replacement for any query part. A view is expanded when the view definition replaces the view name in the query text.  
  
This query hint virtually disallows direct use of indexed views and indexes on indexed views in the query plan.  
  
The indexed view remains condensed if there's a direct reference to the view in the query's SELECT part. The view also remains condensed if you specify WITH (NOEXPAND) or WITH (NOEXPAND, INDEX(index\_value_ [ **,**_...n_ ] ) ). For more information about the query hint NOEXPAND, see [Using NOEXPAND](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-table.md#using-noexpand).  
  
The hint only affects the views in the statements' SELECT part, including those views in INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, and DELETE statements.  
  
FAST _number\_rows_  
Specifies that the query is optimized for fast retrieval of the first _number\_rows_. This result is a nonnegative integer. After the first _number\_rows_ are returned, the query continues execution and produces its full result set.  
  
FORCE ORDER  
Specifies that the join order indicated by the query syntax is preserved during query optimization. Using FORCE ORDER doesn't affect possible role reversal behavior of the Query Optimizer.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> In a MERGE statement, the source table is accessed before the target table as the default join order, unless the WHEN SOURCE NOT MATCHED clause is specified. Specifying FORCE ORDER preserves this default behavior.  
  
{ FORCE | DISABLE } EXTERNALPUSHDOWN  
Force or disable the pushdown of the computation of qualifying expressions in Hadoop. Only applies to queries using PolyBase. Won't push down to Azure storage.  

{ FORCE | DISABLE } SCALEOUTEXECUTION
Force or disable scale out execution of PolyBase queries that are using external tables in SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters. This hint will only be honored by a query using the master instance of a SQL big data cluster. The scale out will occur across the compute pool of the big data cluster. 

KEEP PLAN  
Forces the Query Optimizer to relax the estimated recompile threshold for a query. The estimated recompile threshold starts an automatic recompile for the query when the estimated number of indexed column changes have been made to a table by running one of the following statements:

* UPDATE
* DELETE
* MERGE
* INSERT

Specifying KEEP PLAN makes sure a query won't be recompiled as frequently when there are multiple updates to a table.  
  
KEEPFIXED PLAN  
Forces the Query Optimizer not to recompile a query because of changes in statistics. Specifying KEEPFIXED PLAN makes sure that a query recompiles only if the schema of the underlying tables changes or if **sp_recompile** runs against those tables.  
  
IGNORE_NONCLUSTERED_COLUMNSTORE_INDEX       
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.  
  
Prevents the query from using a nonclustered memory optimized columnstore index. If the query contains the query hint to avoid the use of the columnstore index, and an index hint to use a columnstore index, the hints are in conflict and the query returns an error.  
  
MAX_GRANT_PERCENT = _percent_     
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].  

The maximum memory grant size in PERCENT. The query is guaranteed not to exceed this limit. The actual limit can be lower if the Resource Governor setting is lower than the value specified by this hint. Valid values are between 0.0 and 100.0.  
  
MIN_GRANT_PERCENT = _percent_        
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].   

The minimum memory grant size in PERCENT = % of default limit. The query is guaranteed to get MAX(required memory, min grant) because at least required memory is needed to start a query. Valid values are between 0.0 and 100.0.  
 
MAXDOP _number_      
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssKatmai](../../includes/sskatmai-md.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].  
  
Overrides the **max degree of parallelism** configuration option of **sp_configure**. Also overrides the Resource Governor for the query specifying this option. The MAXDOP query hint can exceed the value configured with sp_configure. If MAXDOP exceeds the value configured with Resource Governor, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] uses the Resource Governor MAXDOP value, described in [ALTER WORKLOAD GROUP &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/alter-workload-group-transact-sql.md). All semantic rules used with the **max degree of parallelism** configuration option are applicable when you use the MAXDOP query hint. For more information, see [Configure the max degree of parallelism Server Configuration Option](../../database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option.md).  
  
> [!WARNING]     
> If MAXDOP is set to zero, then the server chooses the max degree of parallelism.  
  
MAXRECURSION _number_     
Specifies the maximum number of recursions allowed for this query. _number_ is a nonnegative integer between 0 and 32,767. When 0 is specified, no limit is applied. If this option isn't specified, the default limit for the server is 100.  
  
When the specified or default number for MAXRECURSION limit is reached during query execution, the query ends and an error returns.  
  
Because of this error, all effects of the statement are rolled back. If the statement is a SELECT statement, partial results or no results may be returned. Any partial results returned may not include all rows on recursion levels beyond the specified maximum recursion level.  
  
For more information, see [WITH common_table_expression &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/with-common-table-expression-transact-sql.md).     
  
NO_PERFORMANCE_SPOOL    
**Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].   
  
Prevents a spool operator from being added to query plans (except for the plans when spool is required to guarantee valid update semantics). The spool operator may reduce performance in some scenarios. For example, the spool uses tempdb, and tempdb contention can occur if there are many concurrent queries running with the spool operations.  
  
OPTIMIZE FOR ( _\@variable\_name_ { UNKNOWN | = _literal\_constant }_ [ **,** ..._n_ ] )     
Instructs the Query Optimizer to use a particular value for a local variable when the query is compiled and optimized. The value is used only during query optimization, and not during query execution.  
  
_\@variable\_name_  
Is the name of a local variable used in a query, to which a value may be assigned for use with the OPTIMIZE FOR query hint.  
  
_UNKNOWN_  
Specifies that the Query Optimizer uses statistical data instead of the initial value to determine the value for a local variable during query optimization.  
  
_literal\_constant_  
Is a literal constant value to be assigned _\@variable\_name_ for use with the OPTIMIZE FOR query hint. _literal\_constant_ is used only during query optimization, and not as the value of _\@variable\_name_ during query execution. _literal\_constant_ can be of any [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] system data type that can be expressed as a literal constant. The data type of _literal\_constant_ must be implicitly convertible to the data type that _\@variable\_name_ references in the query.  
  
OPTIMIZE FOR can counteract the optimizer's default parameter detection behavior. Also use OPTIMIZE FOR when you create plan guides. For more information, see [Recompile a Stored Procedure](../../relational-databases/stored-procedures/recompile-a-stored-procedure.md).  
  
OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN  
Instructs the Query Optimizer to use statistical data instead of the initial values for all local variables when the query is compiled and optimized. This optimization includes parameters created with forced parameterization.  
  
If you use OPTIMIZE FOR @variable_name = _literal\_constant_ and OPTIMIZE FOR UNKNOWN in the same query hint, the Query Optimizer will use the _literal\_constant_ specified for a specific value. The Query Optimizer will use UNKNOWN for the rest of the variable values. The values are used only during query optimization, and not during query execution.  

PARAMETERIZATION { SIMPLE | FORCED }     
Specifies the parameterization rules that the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Query Optimizer applies to the query when it's compiled.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The PARAMETERIZATION query hint can only be specified inside a plan guide to override the current setting of the PARAMETERIZATION database SET option. It can't be specified directly within a query.    
> For more information, see [Specify Query Parameterization Behavior by Using Plan Guides](../../relational-databases/performance/specify-query-parameterization-behavior-by-using-plan-guides.md).
  
SIMPLE instructs the Query Optimizer to attempt simple parameterization. FORCED instructs the Query Optimizer to attempt forced parameterization. For more information, see [Forced Parameterization in the Query Processing Architecture Guide](../../relational-databases/query-processing-architecture-guide.md#ForcedParam), and [Simple Parameterization in the Query Processing Architecture Guide](../../relational-databases/query-processing-architecture-guide.md#SimpleParam).  

QUERYTRACEON trace_flag    
This option lets you to enable a plan-affecting trace flag only during single-query compilation. Like other query-level options, you can use it together with plan guides to match the text of a query being executed from any session, and automatically apply a plan-affecting trace flag when this query is being compiled. The QUERYTRACEON option is only supported for Query Optimizer trace flags that are documented in the table of "More information" section and in [Trace Flags](../database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md). However, this option will not return any error or warning if an unsupported trace flag number is used. If the specified trace flag is not one that affects a query execution plan, the option will be silently ignored.

More than one trace flag can be specified in the OPTION clause if QUERYTRACEON trace_flag_number is duplicated with different trace flag numbers.

RECOMPILE  
Instructs the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] to generate a new, temporary plan for the query and immediately discard that plan after the query completes execution. The generated query plan doesn't replace a plan stored in cache when the same query runs without the RECOMPILE hint. Without specifying RECOMPILE, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] caches query plans and reuses them. When compiling query plans, the RECOMPILE query hint uses the current values of any local variables in the query. If the query is inside a stored procedure, the current values passed to any parameters.  
  
RECOMPILE is a useful alternative to creating a stored procedure. RECOMPILE uses the WITH RECOMPILE clause when only a subset of queries inside the stored procedure, instead of the whole stored procedure, must be recompiled. For more information, see [Recompile a Stored Procedure](../../relational-databases/stored-procedures/recompile-a-stored-procedure.md). RECOMPILE is also useful when you create plan guides.  
  
ROBUST PLAN  
Forces the Query Optimizer to try a plan that works for the maximum potential row size, possibly at the expense of performance. When the query is processed, intermediate tables and operators may have to store and process rows that are wider than any one of the input rows when the query is processed. The rows may be so wide that, sometimes, the particular operator can't process the row. If rows are that wide, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] produces an error during query execution. By using ROBUST PLAN, you instruct the Query Optimizer not to consider any query plans that may run into this problem.  
  
If such a plan isn't possible, the Query Optimizer returns an error instead of deferring error detection to query execution. Rows may contain variable-length columns; the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] allows for rows to be defined that have a maximum potential size beyond the ability of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] to process them. Generally, despite the maximum potential size, an application stores rows that have actual sizes within the limits that the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] can process. If the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] comes across a row that is too long, an execution error is returned.  
 
<a name="use_hint"></a> USE HINT ( **'**_hint\_name_**'** )    
 **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP1) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].
 
Provides one or more additional hints to the query processor. The additional hints are specified by a hint name **inside single quotation marks**.   

The following hint names are supported:    
 
*  'ASSUME_JOIN_PREDICATE_DEPENDS_ON_FILTERS' <a name="use_hint_join_containment"></a>       
   Causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to generate a query plan using the Simple Containment assumption instead of the default Base Containment assumption for joins, under the Query Optimizer [Cardinality Estimation](../../relational-databases/performance/cardinality-estimation-sql-server.md) model of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] or newer. This hint name is equivalent to [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 9476. 
*  'ASSUME_MIN_SELECTIVITY_FOR_FILTER_ESTIMATES' <a name="use_hint_correlation"></a>      
   Causes [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] to generate a plan using minimum selectivity when estimating AND predicates for filters to account for correlation. This hint name is equivalent to [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 4137 when used with cardinality estimation model of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and earlier versions, and has similar effect when [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 9471 is used with cardinality estimation model of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] or higher.
*  'DISABLE_BATCH_MODE_ADAPTIVE_JOINS'       
   Disables batch mode adaptive joins. For more information, see [Batch mode Adaptive Joins](../../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#batch-mode-adaptive-joins).     
   **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].   
*  'DISABLE_BATCH_MODE_MEMORY_GRANT_FEEDBACK'       
   Disables batch mode memory grant feedback. For more information, see [Batch mode memory grant feedback](../../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#batch-mode-memory-grant-feedback).     
   **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].   
* 'DISABLE_DEFERRED_COMPILATION_TV'

  **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].   
*  'DISABLE_INTERLEAVED_EXECUTION_TVF'      
   Disables interleaved execution for multi-statement table-valued functions. For more information, see [Interleaved execution for multi-statement table-valued functions](../../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#interleaved-execution-for-mstvfs).     
   **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].   
*  'DISABLE_OPTIMIZED_NESTED_LOOP'      
   Instructs the query processor not to use a sort operation (batch sort) for optimized nested loop joins when generating a query plan. This hint name is equivalent to [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 2340.
*  'DISABLE_OPTIMIZER_ROWGOAL' <a name="use_hint_rowgoal"></a>      
   Causes SQL Server to generate a plan that doesn't use row goal modifications with queries that contain these keywords: 
   
   * TOP
   * OPTION (FAST N)
   * IN
   * EXISTS
   
   This hint name is equivalent to [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 4138.
*  'DISABLE_PARAMETER_SNIFFING'      
   Instructs Query Optimizer to use average data distribution while compiling a query with one or more parameters. This instruction makes the query plan independent on the parameter value that was first used when the query was compiled. This hint name is equivalent to [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 4136 or [Database Scoped Configuration](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md) setting `PARAMETER_SNIFFING = OFF`.
* 'DISABLE_ROW_MODE_MEMORY_GRANT_FEEDBACK'    
  Disables row mode memory grant feedback. For more information, see [Row mode memory grant feedback](../../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#row-mode-memory-grant-feedback).

* 'DISABLE_TSQL_SCALAR_UDF_INLINING'    
  Disables scalar UDF inlining. For more information, see [Scalar UDF Inlining](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/scalar-udf-inlining.md).     
  **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]).    
* 'DISALLOW_BATCH_MODE'    
  Disables batch mode execution. For more information, see [Execution modes](../../relational-databases/query-processing-architecture-guide.md#execution-modes).     
  **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]) and [!INCLUDE[ssSDSfull](../../includes/sssdsfull-md.md)].     
*  'ENABLE_HIST_AMENDMENT_FOR_ASC_KEYS'      
   Enables automatically generated quick statistics (histogram amendment) for any leading index column for which cardinality estimation is needed. The histogram used to estimate cardinality will be adjusted at query compile time to account for actual maximum or minimum value of this column. This hint name is equivalent to [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 4139. 
*  'ENABLE_QUERY_OPTIMIZER_HOTFIXES'     
   Enables Query Optimizer hotfixes (changes released in SQL Server Cumulative Updates and Service Packs). This hint name is equivalent to [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 4199 or [Database Scoped Configuration](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md) setting `QUERY_OPTIMIZER_HOTFIXES = ON`.
*  'FORCE_DEFAULT_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION'      
   Forces the Query Optimizer to use [Cardinality Estimation](../../relational-databases/performance/cardinality-estimation-sql-server.md) model that corresponds to the current database compatibility level. Use this hint to override [Database Scoped Configuration](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md) setting `LEGACY_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION = ON` or [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 9481.
*  'FORCE_LEGACY_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION' <a name="use_hint_ce70"></a>      
   Forces the Query Optimizer to use [Cardinality Estimation](../../relational-databases/performance/cardinality-estimation-sql-server.md) model of [!INCLUDE[ssSQL11](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and earlier versions. This hint name is equivalent to [trace flag](../../t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql.md) 9481 or [Database Scoped Configuration](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-scoped-configuration-transact-sql.md) setting `LEGACY_CARDINALITY_ESTIMATION = ON`.
*  'QUERY_OPTIMIZER_COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL_n'          
 Forces the Query Optimizer behavior at a query level. This behavior happens as if the query was compiled with database compatibility level _n_, where _n_ is a supported database compatibility level. Refer to [sys.dm_exec_valid_use_hints](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-valid-use-hints-transact-sql.md) for a list of currently supported values for _n_.

   > The QUERY_OPTIMIZER_COMPATIBILITY_LEVEL_n hint doesn't override default or legacy cardinality estimation setting, if it's forced through database scoped configuration, trace flag or another query hint such as QUERYTRACEON.   
   > This hint only affects the behavior of the Query Optimizer. It doesn't affect other features of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] that may depend on the [database compatibility level](../../t-sql/statements/alter-database-transact-sql-compatibility-level.md), such as the availability of certain database features.

*  'QUERY_PLAN_PROFILE'      
 Enables lightweight profiling for the query. When a query that contains this new hint finishes, a new Extended Event, query_plan_profile, is fired. This extended event exposes execution statistics and actual execution plan XML similar to the query_post_execution_showplan extended event but only for queries that contains the new hint.    
   **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] SP2 CU3 and [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] CU11). 

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you enable collecting the query_post_execution_showplan extended event, this will add standard profiling infrastructure to every query that is running on the server and therefore may affect overall server performance.      
   > If you enable the collection of *query_thread_profile* extended event to use lightweight profiling infrastructure instead, this will result in much less performance overhead but will still affect overall server performance.       
   > If you enable the query_plan_profile extended event, this will only enable the lightweight profiling infrastructure for a query that executed with the QUERY_PLAN_PROFILE and therefore will not affect other workloads on the server. Use this hint to profile a specific query without affecting other parts of the server workload.

The list of all supported USE HINT names can be queried using the dynamic management view [sys.dm_exec_valid_use_hints](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-valid-use-hints-transact-sql.md).    

> [!TIP]
> Hint names are case-insensitive.   
  
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Some USE HINT hints may conflict with trace flags enabled at the global or session level, or database scoped configuration settings. In this case, the query level hint (USE HINT) always takes precedence. If a USE HINT conflicts with another query hint, or a trace flag enabled at the query level (such as by QUERYTRACEON), [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] will generate an error when trying to execute the query. 

<a name="use-plan"></a> USE PLAN N'_xml\_plan_'  
 Forces the Query Optimizer to use an existing query plan for a query that is specified by **'**_xml\_plan_**'**. USE PLAN cannot be specified with INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE, or DELETE statements.  
  
TABLE HINT **(**_exposed\_object\_name_ [ **,** \<table_hint> [ [**,** ]..._n_ ] ] **)**
 Applies the specified table hint to the table or view that corresponds to _exposed\_object\_name_. We recommend using a table hint as a query hint only in the context of a [plan guide](../../relational-databases/performance/plan-guides.md).  
  
 _exposed\_object\_name_ can be one of the following references:  
  
-   When an alias is used for the table or view in the [FROM](../../t-sql/queries/from-transact-sql.md) clause of the query, _exposed\_object\_name_ is the alias.  
  
-   When an alias isn't used, _exposed\_object\_name_ is the exact match of the table or view referenced in the FROM clause. For example, if the table or view is referenced using a two-part name, _exposed\_object\_name_ is the same two-part name.  
  
 When you specify _exposed\_object\_name_ without also specifying a table hint, any indexes you specify in the query as part of a table hint for the object are disregarded. The Query Optimizer then determines index usage. You can use this technique to eliminate the effect of an INDEX table hint when you can't modify the original query. See Example J.  
  
**\<table_hint> ::=** { [ NOEXPAND ] { INDEX ( _index\_value_ [ ,..._n_ ] ) | INDEX = ( _index\_value_ ) | FORCESEEK [**(**_index\_value_**(**_index\_column\_name_ [**,**... ] **))** ]| FORCESCAN | HOLDLOCK | NOLOCK | NOWAIT | PAGLOCK | READCOMMITTED | READCOMMITTEDLOCK | READPAST | READUNCOMMITTED | REPEATABLEREAD | ROWLOCK | SERIALIZABLE | SNAPSHOT | SPATIAL_WINDOW_MAX_CELLS | TABLOCK | TABLOCKX | UPDLOCK | XLOCK }
 Is the table hint to apply to the table or view that corresponds to *exposed_object_name* as a query hint. For a description of these hints, see [Table Hints &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/queries/hints-transact-sql-table.md).  
  
 Table hints other than INDEX, FORCESCAN, and FORCESEEK are disallowed as query hints unless the query already has a WITH clause specifying the table hint. For more information, see Remarks.  
  
> [!CAUTION] 
> Specifying FORCESEEK with parameters limits the number of plans that can be considered by the optimizer more than when specifying FORCESEEK without parameters. This may cause a "Plan cannot be generated" error to occur in more cases. In a future release, internal modifications to the optimizer may allow more plans to be considered.  
  
## Remarks  
 Query hints cannot be specified in an INSERT statement, except when a SELECT clause is used inside the statement.  
  
 Query hints can be specified only in the top-level query, not in subqueries. When a table hint is specified as a query hint, the hint can be specified in the top-level query or in a subquery. However, the value specified for _exposed\_object\_name_ in the TABLE HINT clause must match exactly the exposed name in the query or subquery.  
  
## Specifying Table Hints as Query Hints  
 We recommend using the INDEX, FORCESCAN, or FORCESEEK table hint as a query hint only in the context of a [plan guide](../../relational-databases/performance/plan-guides.md). Plan guides are useful when you can't modify the original query, for example, because it's a third-party application. The query hint specified in the plan guide is added to the query before it's compiled and optimized. For ad-hoc queries, use the TABLE HINT clause only when testing plan guide statements. For all other ad-hoc queries, we recommend specifying these hints only as table hints.  
  
 When specified as a query hint, the INDEX, FORCESCAN, and FORCESEEK table hints are valid for the following objects:  
  
-   Tables  
-   Views  
-   Indexed views  
-   Common table expressions (the hint must be specified in the SELECT statement whose result set populates the common table expression)  
-   Dynamic management views  
-   Named subqueries  
  
You can specify INDEX, FORCESCAN, and FORCESEEK table hints as query hints for a query that doesn't have any existing table hints. You can also use them to replace existing INDEX, FORCESCAN, or FORCESEEK hints in the query, respectively. 

Table hints other than INDEX, FORCESCAN, and FORCESEEK are disallowed as query hints unless the query already has a WITH clause specifying the table hint. In this case, a matching hint must also be specified as a query hint. Specify the matching hint as a query hint by using TABLE HINT in the OPTION clause. This specification preserves the query's semantics. For example, if the query contains the table hint NOLOCK, the OPTION clause in the **\@hints** parameter of the plan guide must also contain the NOLOCK hint. See Example K. 

Error 8072 occurs in a couple of scenarios. One is when you specify a table hint other than INDEX, FORCESCAN, or FORCESEEK by using TABLE HINT in the OPTION clause without a matching query hint. The second scenario is the other way around. This error indicates the OPTION clause can cause the semantics of the query to change, and the query fails.  
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Using MERGE JOIN  
 The following example specifies that MERGE JOIN runs the JOIN operation in the query. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
SELECT *   
FROM Sales.Customer AS c  
INNER JOIN Sales.CustomerAddress AS ca ON c.CustomerID = ca.CustomerID  
WHERE TerritoryID = 5  
OPTION (MERGE JOIN);  
GO    
```  
  
### B. Using OPTIMIZE FOR  
 The following example instructs the Query Optimizer to use the value `'Seattle'` for local variable `@city_name` and to use statistical data to determine the value for the local variable `@postal_code` when optimizing the query. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
DECLARE @city_name nvarchar(30);  
DECLARE @postal_code nvarchar(15);  
SET @city_name = 'Ascheim';  
SET @postal_code = 86171;  
SELECT * FROM Person.Address  
WHERE City = @city_name AND PostalCode = @postal_code  
OPTION ( OPTIMIZE FOR (@city_name = 'Seattle', @postal_code UNKNOWN) );  
GO  
```  
  
### C. Using MAXRECURSION  
 MAXRECURSION can be used to prevent a poorly formed recursive common table expression from entering into an infinite loop. The following example intentionally creates an infinite loop and uses the MAXRECURSION hint to limit the number of recursion levels to two. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
--Creates an infinite loop  
WITH cte (CustomerID, PersonID, StoreID) AS  
(  
    SELECT CustomerID, PersonID, StoreID  
    FROM Sales.Customer  
    WHERE PersonID IS NOT NULL  
  UNION ALL  
    SELECT cte.CustomerID, cte.PersonID, cte.StoreID  
    FROM cte   
    JOIN  Sales.Customer AS e   
        ON cte.PersonID = e.CustomerID  
)  
--Uses MAXRECURSION to limit the recursive levels to 2  
SELECT CustomerID, PersonID, StoreID  
FROM cte  
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 2);  
GO  
```  
  
 After the coding error is corrected, MAXRECURSION is no longer required.  
  
### D. Using MERGE UNION  
 The following example uses the MERGE UNION query hint. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
SELECT *  
FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e1  
UNION  
SELECT *  
FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e2  
OPTION (MERGE UNION);  
GO  
```  
  
### E. Using HASH GROUP and FAST  
 The following example uses the HASH GROUP and FAST query hints. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
SELECT ProductID, OrderQty, SUM(LineTotal) AS Total  
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail  
WHERE UnitPrice < $5.00  
GROUP BY ProductID, OrderQty  
ORDER BY ProductID, OrderQty  
OPTION (HASH GROUP, FAST 10);  
GO    
```  
  
### F. Using MAXDOP  
 The following example uses the MAXDOP query hint. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
SELECT ProductID, OrderQty, SUM(LineTotal) AS Total  
FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail  
WHERE UnitPrice < $5.00  
GROUP BY ProductID, OrderQty  
ORDER BY ProductID, OrderQty  
OPTION (MAXDOP 2);    
GO
```  
  
### G. Using INDEX  
 The following examples use the INDEX hint. The first example specifies a single index. The second example specifies multiple indexes for a single table reference. In both examples, because you apply the INDEX hint on a table that uses an alias, the TABLE HINT clause must also specify the same alias as the exposed object name. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
EXEC sp_create_plan_guide   
    @name = N'Guide1',   
    @stmt = N'SELECT c.LastName, c.FirstName, e.Title  
              FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e   
              JOIN Person.Contact AS c ON e.ContactID = c.ContactID  
              WHERE e.ManagerID = 2;',   
    @type = N'SQL',  
    @module_or_batch = NULL,   
    @params = NULL,   
    @hints = N'OPTION (TABLE HINT(e, INDEX (IX_Employee_ManagerID)))';  
GO  
EXEC sp_create_plan_guide   
    @name = N'Guide2',   
    @stmt = N'SELECT c.LastName, c.FirstName, e.Title  
              FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e  
              JOIN Person.Contact AS c ON e.ContactID = c.ContactID  
              WHERE e.ManagerID = 2;',   
    @type = N'SQL',  
    @module_or_batch = NULL,   
    @params = NULL,   
    @hints = N'OPTION (TABLE HINT(e, INDEX(PK_Employee_EmployeeID, IX_Employee_ManagerID)))';  
GO    
```  
  
### H. Using FORCESEEK  
 The following example uses the FORCESEEK table hint. The TABLE HINT clause must also specify the same two-part name as the exposed object name. Specify the name when you apply the INDEX hint on a table that uses a two-part name. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
EXEC sp_create_plan_guide   
    @name = N'Guide3',   
    @stmt = N'SELECT c.LastName, c.FirstName, HumanResources.Employee.Title  
              FROM HumanResources.Employee  
              JOIN Person.Contact AS c ON HumanResources.Employee.ContactID = c.ContactID  
              WHERE HumanResources.Employee.ManagerID = 3  
              ORDER BY c.LastName, c.FirstName;',   
    @type = N'SQL',  
    @module_or_batch = NULL,   
    @params = NULL,   
    @hints = N'OPTION (TABLE HINT( HumanResources.Employee, FORCESEEK))';  
GO    
```  
  
### I. Using multiple table hints  
 The following example applies the INDEX hint to one table and the FORCESEEK hint to another. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
EXEC sp_create_plan_guide   
    @name = N'Guide4',   
    @stmt = N'SELECT e.ManagerID, c.LastName, c.FirstName, e.Title  
              FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e   
              JOIN Person.Contact AS c ON e.ContactID = c.ContactID  
              WHERE e.ManagerID = 3;',   
    @type = N'SQL',  
    @module_or_batch = NULL,   
    @params = NULL,   
    @hints = N'OPTION (TABLE HINT (e, INDEX( IX_Employee_ManagerID))   
                       , TABLE HINT (c, FORCESEEK))';  
GO  
```  
  
### J. Using TABLE HINT to override an existing table hint  
The following example shows how to use the TABLE HINT hint. You can use the hint without specifying a hint to override the INDEX table hint behavior you specify in the FROM clause of the query. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
EXEC sp_create_plan_guide   
    @name = N'Guide5',   
    @stmt = N'SELECT e.ManagerID, c.LastName, c.FirstName, e.Title  
              FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e WITH (INDEX (IX_Employee_ManagerID))  
              JOIN Person.Contact AS c ON e.ContactID = c.ContactID  
              WHERE e.ManagerID = 3;',   
    @type = N'SQL',  
    @module_or_batch = NULL,   
    @params = NULL,   
    @hints = N'OPTION (TABLE HINT(e))';  
GO    
```  
  
### K. Specifying semantics-affecting table hints  
The following example contains two table hints in the query: NOLOCK, which is semantic-affecting, and INDEX, which is non-semantic-affecting. To preserve the semantics of the query, the NOLOCK hint is specified in the OPTIONS clause of the plan guide. Along with the NOLOCK hint, specify the INDEX and FORCESEEK hints and replace the non-semantic-affecting INDEX hint in the query during statement compilation and optimization. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
EXEC sp_create_plan_guide   
    @name = N'Guide6',   
    @stmt = N'SELECT c.LastName, c.FirstName, e.Title  
              FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e   
                   WITH (NOLOCK, INDEX (PK_Employee_EmployeeID))  
              JOIN Person.Contact AS c ON e.ContactID = c.ContactID  
              WHERE e.ManagerID = 3;',  
    @type = N'SQL',  
    @module_or_batch = NULL,   
    @params = NULL,   
    @hints = N'OPTION (TABLE HINT (e, INDEX(IX_Employee_ManagerID), NOLOCK, FORCESEEK))';  
GO    
```  
  
The following example shows an alternative method to preserving the semantics of the query and allowing the optimizer to choose an index other than the index specified in the table hint. Allow the optimizer to choose by specifying the NOLOCK hint in the OPTIONS clause. You specify the hint because it's semantic-affecting. Then, specify the TABLE HINT keyword with only a table reference and no INDEX hint. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
EXEC sp_create_plan_guide   
    @name = N'Guide7',   
    @stmt = N'SELECT c.LastName, c.FirstName, e.Title  
              FROM HumanResources.Employee AS e   
                   WITH (NOLOCK, INDEX (PK_Employee_EmployeeID))  
              JOIN Person.Contact AS c ON e.ContactID = c.ContactID  
              WHERE e.ManagerID = 2;',  
    @type = N'SQL',  
    @module_or_batch = NULL,   
    @params = NULL,   
    @hints = N'OPTION (TABLE HINT (e, NOLOCK))';  
GO  
```  
### L. Using USE HINT  
 The following example uses the RECOMPILE and USE HINT query hints. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database.  
  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM Person.Address  
WHERE City = 'SEATTLE' AND PostalCode = 98104
OPTION (RECOMPILE, USE HINT ('ASSUME_MIN_SELECTIVITY_FOR_FILTER_ESTIMATES', 'DISABLE_PARAMETER_SNIFFING')); 
GO  
```  
### M. Using QUERYTRACEON HINT  
 The following example uses the QUERYTRACEON query hints. The example uses the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBobject](../../includes/sssampledbobject-md.md)] database. You can enable all plan-affecting hotfixes controlled by trace flag 4199 for a particular query using the following query:
  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM Person.Address  
WHERE City = 'SEATTLE' AND PostalCode = 98104
OPTION (QUERYTRACEON 4199);
```  

 You can also use multiple trace flags as in the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Person.Address  
WHERE City = 'SEATTLE' AND PostalCode = 98104
OPTION  (QUERYTRACEON 4199, QUERYTRACEON 4137);
```
