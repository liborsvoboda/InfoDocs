# Schema Compare extension
The Schema Compare extension provides an easy-to-use experience to compare two database definitions and apply the differences from the source to the target.


## Features

* Compare schemas of two dacpac files or databases
* View results as a set of actions that must be taken against the target for it to match the source
* Selectively exclude actions listed in results
* Set options that control the scope of the comparison
* Apply changes to target or generate a script with the same effect
* Save the comparison

## Why Would I Use the Schema Compare Extension?

It can be tedious to manually manage and synchronize different database versions. The Schema Compare extension simplifies the process of comparing databases and gives you full control when synchronizing them &mdash; you can selectively filter specific differences and categories of differences before applying the changes. The Schema Compare extension is a reliable tool that will save you time and code.
