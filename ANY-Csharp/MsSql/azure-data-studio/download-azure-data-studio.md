## Get Azure Data Studio for Windows

This release of [!INCLUDE[name-sos](../includes/name-sos-short.md)] includes a standard Windows installer experience, and a .zip file.

The *user installer* is recommended because it does not require administrator privileges, which simplifies both installs and upgrades. The user installer does not require Administrator privileges as the location is under your user Local AppData (LOCALAPPDATA) folder.

## Supported SQL offerings

- This version of Azure Data Studio works with all [supported versions of SQL Server 2014 - [!INCLUDE[sql-server-2019](../includes/sssqlv15-md.md)]](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle?C2=1044) and provides support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Azure Data Studio also provides preview support for Azure SQL Managed Instance.

## Upgrade from SQL Operations Studio

If you are still using SQL Operations Studio, you need to upgrade to Azure Data Studio. SQL Operations Studio was the preview name and preview version of Azure Data Studio. In September 2018, we [changed the name to Azure Data Studio](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2018/09/25/azure-data-studio-for-sql-server/) and released the General Availability (GA) version. Because SQL Operations Studio is no longer being updated or supported, we ask all SQL Operations Studio users to download the latest version of Azure Data Studio to get the latest features, security updates, and fixes.

When upgrading from the old preview to the latest Azure Data Studio, you will lose your current settings and extensions. To move your settings, follow the instructions in the following *Move user settings* section:

## Move user settings

If you want to move your custom settings, keyboard shortcuts, or code snippets, follow the steps below. This is important to do if you are upgrading from SQL Operations Studio version to Azure Data Studio.

*If you already have Azure Data Studio, or you've never installed or customized SQL Operations Studio, then you can ignore this section.*

1. Open Settings by clicking the gear on the bottom left and clicking **Settings.**

   ![open-settings](./media/download/open-settings.png)

2. Right-click the **User Settings** tab on top and click **Reveal in Explorer**

   ![reveal-in-explorer](./media/download/reveal-in-explorer.png)

3. Copy all files in this folder and save in an easy to find location on your local drive, like your Documents folder.

   ![copy-settings](./media/download/copy-settings.png)

4. In your new version of Azure Data Studio, follow steps 1-2, then for step 3 paste the contents you saved into the folder. You can also manually copy over the settings, keybindings, or snippets in their respective locations.

5. If overriding an existing installation, delete the old install directory before installation to avoid errors connecting to your Azure account for the resource explorer.
