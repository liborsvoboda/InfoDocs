# Deprecated features in SQL Server 2019 Reporting Services

[!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto](../includes/ssrs-appliesto.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-2019-and-later](../includes/ssrs-appliesto-2019-and-later.md)] [!INCLUDE [ssrs-appliesto-pbirs](../includes/ssrs-appliesto-pbirs.md)]

When we mark a feature as deprecated, it means:

- The feature is in maintenance mode only. We'll make no new changes, including changes related to interoperability with new features.
- We strive not to remove a deprecated feature from future releases, to make upgrades easier. However, in rare situations, we may choose to permanently remove the feature from Reporting Services if it limits future innovations.
- For new development work, we don't recommend using deprecated features.

**Features deprecated in a future version of SQL Server**

SQL Server Reporting Services supports the following features in the next version of SQL Server, but will deprecate them in a later version. The specific version of SQL Server hasn't been determined.

| **Category** | **Deprecated feature** | **Replacement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Report Server | Report Part Gallery | None |
| Report Server | Mobile Reports and Mobile Report Publisher | Power BI reports in Power BI Report Server offer mobile capabilities. |
| Report Server | XLS and DOC render formats | XLSX and DOCX formats are available and supported. |
| Report Server | Atom Data Feed | oData feed support is available for shared datasets in SSRS and Power BI Report Server. |
