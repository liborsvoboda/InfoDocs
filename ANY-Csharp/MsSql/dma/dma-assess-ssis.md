# Perform a SQL Server Integration Service migration assessment with Data Migration Assistant

## Prerequisites

To assess SQL Server Integration Service(SSIS) packages, below components need to be installed with Data Migration Assistant:

- SQL Server Integration Service with the same version as the SSIS packages to assess.
- Azure Feature Pack or other third party components if SSIS packages to assess have these components.  

DMA needs to run with **administrator** access to assess SSIS packages in Package Store.
