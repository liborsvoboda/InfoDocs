# olapR (R library in SQL Server)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

**olapR** is a Microsoft library of R functions used for MDX queries against a SQL Server Analysis Services OLAP cube. Functions do not support all MDX operations, but you can build queries that slice, dice, drilldown, rollup, and pivot on dimensions. 

This package is not preloaded into an R session. Run the following command to load the library.

```R
library(olapR)
```

You can use this library on connections to an Analysis Services OLAP cube on all supported versions of SQL Server. Connections to a tabular model are not supported at this time.

## Package version

Current version is 1.0.0 in all Windows-only products and downloads providing the library.

## Full reference documentation

The **olapr** library is distributed in multiple Microsoft products, but usage is the same whether you get the library in SQL Server or another product. Because the functions are the same, [documentation for individual sqlrutils functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/olapr/olapr) is published to just one location under the [R reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/machine-learning-server/r-reference/introducing-r-server-r-package-reference) for Microsoft Machine Learning Server. Should any product-specific behaviors exist, discrepancies will be noted in the function help page.

## Availability and location

This package is provided in the following products, as well as on several virtual machine images on Azure. Package location varies accordingly.
