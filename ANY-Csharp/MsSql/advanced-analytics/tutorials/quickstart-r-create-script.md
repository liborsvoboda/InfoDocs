# Quickstart: Run simple R scripts with SQL Server Machine Learning Services
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

In this quickstart, you'll run a set of simple R scripts using [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../what-is-sql-server-machine-learning.md). You'll learn how to use the stored procedure [sp_execute_external_script](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md) to execute the script in a SQL Server instance.

## Prerequisites

- This quickstart requires access to an instance of SQL Server with [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install.md) with the R language installed.

  Your SQL Server instance can be in an Azure virtual machine or on-premises. Just be aware that the external scripting feature is disabled by default, so you might need to [enable external scripting](../install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install.md#bkmk_enableFeature) and verify that **SQL Server Launchpad service** is running before you start.

- You also need a tool for running SQL queries that contain R scripts. You can run these scripts using any database management or query tool, as long as it can connect to a SQL Server instance, and run a T-SQL query or stored procedure. This quickstart uses [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms).

## Run a simple script

To run an R script, you'll pass it as an argument to the system stored procedure, [sp_execute_external_script](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-execute-external-script-transact-sql.md).
This system stored procedure starts the R runtime in the context of SQL Server, passes data to R, manages R user sessions securely, and returns any results to the client.

In the following steps, you'll run this example R script in your SQL Server instance:

```r
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- a/b
d <- a*b
print(c(c, d))
```

1. Open **SQL Server Management Studio** and connect to your SQL Server instance.

1. Pass the complete R script to the `sp_execute_external_script` stored procedure.

   The script is passed through the `@script` argument. Everything inside the `@script` argument must be valid R code.

    ```sql
    EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
        , @script = N'
    a <- 1
    b <- 2
    c <- a/b
    d <- a*b
    print(c(c, d))
    '
    ```

1. The correct result is calculated and the R `print` function returns the result to the **Messages** window.

   It should look something like this.

    **Results**

    ```text
    STDOUT message(s) from external script:
    0.5 2
    ```

## Run a Hello World script

A typical example script is one that just outputs the string "Hello World". Run the following command.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'OutputDataSet<-InputDataSet'
    , @input_data_1 = N'SELECT 1 AS hello'
WITH RESULT SETS(([Hello World] INT));
GO
```

Inputs to the `sp_execute_external_script` stored procedure include:

| | |
|-|-|
| @language | defines the language extension to call, in this case, R |
| @script | defines the commands passed to the R runtime. Your entire R script must be enclosed in this argument, as Unicode text. You could also add the text to a variable of type **nvarchar** and then call the variable |
| @input_data_1 | data returned by the query, passed to the R runtime, which returns the data to SQL Server as a data frame |
|WITH RESULT SETS | clause defines the schema of the returned data table for SQL Server, adding "Hello World" as the column name, **int** for the data type |

The command outputs the following text:

| Hello World |
|-------------|
| 1 |

## Use inputs and outputs

By default, `sp_execute_external_script` accepts a single dataset as input, which typically you supply in the form of a valid SQL query. It then returns a single R data frame as output.

For now, let's use the default input and output variables of `sp_execute_external_script`: **InputDataSet** and **OutputDataSet**.

1. Create a small table of test data.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE RTestData (col1 INT NOT NULL)
    
    INSERT INTO RTestData
    VALUES (1);
    
    INSERT INTO RTestData
    VALUES (10);
    
    INSERT INTO RTestData
    VALUES (100);
    GO
    ```

1. Use the `SELECT` statement to query the table.
  
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM RTestData
    ```

    **Results**

    ![Contents of the RTestData table](./media/select-rtestdata.png)

1. Run the following R script. It retrieves the data from the table using the `SELECT` statement, passes it through the R runtime, and returns the data as a data frame. The `WITH RESULT SETS` clause defines the schema of the returned data table for SQL, adding the column name *NewColName*.

    ```sql
    EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
        , @script = N'OutputDataSet <- InputDataSet;'
        , @input_data_1 = N'SELECT * FROM RTestData;'
    WITH RESULT SETS(([NewColName] INT NOT NULL));
    ```

    **Results**

    ![Output from R script that returns data from a table](./media/r-output-rtestdata.png)

1. Now let's change the names of the input and output variables. The default input and output variable names are **InputDataSet** and **OutputDataSet**, this script changes the names to **SQL_in** and **SQL_out**:

    ```sql
    EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
        , @script = N' SQL_out <- SQL_in;'
        , @input_data_1 = N' SELECT 12 as Col;'
        , @input_data_1_name = N'SQL_in'
        , @output_data_1_name = N'SQL_out'
    WITH RESULT SETS(([NewColName] INT NOT NULL));
    ```

    Note that R is case-sensitive. The input and output variables used in the R script (**SQL_out**, **SQL_in**) need to match the names defined with `@input_data_1_name` and `@output_data_1_name`, including case.

   > [!TIP]
   > Only one input dataset can be passed as a parameter, and you can return only one dataset. However, you can call other datasets from inside your R code and you can return outputs of other types in addition to the dataset. You can also add the OUTPUT keyword to any parameter to have it returned with the results.

1. You also can generate values just using the R script with no input data (`@input_data_1` is set to blank).

   The following script outputs the text "hello" and "world".

    ```sql
    EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
        , @script = N'
    mytextvariable <- c("hello", " ", "world");
    OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(mytextvariable);
    '
        , @input_data_1 = N''
    WITH RESULT SETS(([Col1] CHAR(20) NOT NULL));
    ```

    **Results**

    ![Query results using @script as input](./media/r-data-generated-output.png)

## Check R version

If you would like to see which version of R is installed in your SQL Server instance, run the following script.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'print(version)';
GO
```

The R `print` function returns the version to the **Messages** window. In the example output below, you can see that in this case, R version 3.4.4 is installed.

**Results**

```text
STDOUT message(s) from external script:
                   _
platform       x86_64-w64-mingw32
arch           x86_64
os             mingw32
system         x86_64, mingw32
status
major          3
minor          4.4
year           2018
month          03
day            15
svn rev        74408
language       R
version.string R version 3.4.4 (2018-03-15)
nickname       Someone to Lean On
```

## List R packages

Microsoft provides a number of R packages pre-installed with SQL Server Machine Learning Services.

To see a list of which R packages are installed, including version, dependencies, license, and library path information, run the following script.

```SQL
EXEC sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
OutputDataSet <- data.frame(installed.packages()[,c("Package", "Version", "Depends", "License", "LibPath")]);'
WITH result sets((
            Package NVARCHAR(255)
            , Version NVARCHAR(100)
            , Depends NVARCHAR(4000)
            , License NVARCHAR(1000)
            , LibPath NVARCHAR(2000)
            ));
```

The output is from `installed.packages()` in R and is returned as a result set.
