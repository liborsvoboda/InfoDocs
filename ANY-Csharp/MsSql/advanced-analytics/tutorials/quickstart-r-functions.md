# Quickstart: R functions with SQL Server Machine Learning Services
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

In this quickstart, you'll learn how to use R mathematical and utility functions with SQL Server Machine Learning Services. Statistical functions are often complicated to implement in T-SQL, but can be done in R with only a few lines of code.

## Prerequisites

- This quickstart requires access to an instance of SQL Server with [SQL Server Machine Learning Services](../install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install.md) with the R language installed.

  Your SQL Server instance can be in an Azure virtual machine or on-premises. Just be aware that the external scripting feature is disabled by default, so you might need to [enable external scripting](../install/sql-machine-learning-services-windows-install.md#bkmk_enableFeature) and verify that **SQL Server Launchpad service** is running before you start.

- You also need a tool for running SQL queries that contain R scripts. You can run these scripts using any database management or query tool, as long as it can connect to a SQL Server instance, and run a T-SQL query or stored procedure. This quickstart uses [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms).

## Create a stored procedure to generate random numbers

For simplicity, let's use the R `stats` package, that's installed and loaded by default in SQL Server Machine Learning Services with R installed. The package contains hundreds of functions for common statistical tasks, among them the `rnorm` function, which generates a specified number of random numbers using the normal distribution, given a standard deviation and mean.

For example, the following R code returns 100 numbers on a mean of 50, given a standard deviation of 3.

```R
as.data.frame(rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 3));
```

To call this line of R from T-SQL, add the R function in the R script parameter of `sp_execute_external_script`, like this:

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script
      @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
         OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd =3));'
    , @input_data_1 = N'   ;'
      WITH RESULT SETS (([Density] float NOT NULL));
```

What if you'd like to make it easier to generate a different set of random numbers?

That's easy when combined with SQL Server. You define a stored procedure that gets the arguments from the user, then pass those arguments into the R script as variables.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE MyRNorm (
    @param1 INT
    , @param2 INT
    , @param3 INT
    )
AS
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
	     OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(rnorm(mynumbers, mymean, mysd));'
    , @input_data_1 = N'   ;'
    , @params = N' @mynumbers int, @mymean int, @mysd int'
    , @mynumbers = @param1
    , @mymean = @param2
    , @mysd = @param3
WITH RESULT SETS(([Density] FLOAT NOT NULL));
```

- The first line defines each of the SQL input parameters that are required when the stored procedure is executed.

- The line beginning with `@params` defines all variables used by the R code, and the corresponding SQL data types.

- The lines that immediately follow map the SQL parameter names to the corresponding R variable names.

Now that you've wrapped the R function in a stored procedure, you can easily call the function and pass in different values, like this:

```sql
EXECUTE MyRNorm @param1 = 100,@param2 = 50, @param3 = 3
```

## Use R utility functions for troubleshooting

The **utils** package, installed by default,  provides a variety of utility functions for investigating the current R environment. These functions can be useful if you're finding discrepancies in the way your R code performs in SQL Server and in outside environments.

For example, you might use the R `memory.limit()` function to get memory for the current R environment. Because the `utils` package is installed but not loaded by default, you must use the `library()` function to load it first.

```sql
EXECUTE sp_execute_external_script
      @language = N'R'
    , @script = N'
        library(utils);
        mymemory <- memory.limit();
        OutputDataSet <- as.data.frame(mymemory);'
    , @input_data_1 = N' ;'
WITH RESULT SETS (([Col1] int not null));
```

> [!TIP]
> Many users like to use the system timing functions in R, such as `system.time` and `proc.time`, to capture the time used by R processes and analyze performance issues. For an example, see the tutorial [Create Data Features](../tutorials/walkthrough-create-data-features.md) where R timing functions are embedded in the solution.
