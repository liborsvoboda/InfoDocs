# Edge constraints

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

Edge constraints can be used to enforce data integrity and specific semantics on the edge tables in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] graph database.

## <a name="Connection"></a> Edge Constraints

In the first release of graph features, edge tables did not enforce anything for the endpoints of the edge. That is, an edge in a graph database could connect any node to any other node, regardless of the type.

This release introduces edge constraints, which enable users to add constraints to their edge tables, thereby enforcing specific semantics and also maintaining data integrity. When a new edge is added to an edge table with edge constraints, the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)] enforces that the nodes which the edge is trying to connect, exist in the proper node tables. It is also ensured that a node cannot be dropped, if it is still referenced by an edge.

### Edge Constraint Clauses

Each edge constraint consists of one or more edge constraint clause(s). An edge constraint clause is the pair of FROM and TO nodes that the given edge could connect.

Consider that you have `Product` and `Customer` nodes in your graph and you use `Bought` edge to connect these nodes. The edge constraint clause specifies the FROM and TO node pair and the direction of the edge. In this case the edge constraint clause will be `Customer` TO `Product`. That is,
 inserting a `Bought` that goes from a `Customer` to `Product` will be allowed. Attempts to insert an edge that goes from `Product` to `Customer` fail.

- An edge constraint clause contains a pair of FROM and TO node tables that the edge constraint is enforced on.
- Users may specify multiple edge constraint clauses per edge constraint, which will be applied as a disjunction.
- If multiple edge constraints are created on a single edge table, edges must satisfy ALL constraints to be allowed.

### Indexes on edge constraints

Creating an edge constraint does not automatically create a corresponding index on `$from_id` and `$to_id` columns in the edge table. Manually creating an index on a `$from_id`, `$to_id` pair is recommended if you have point lookup queries or OLTP workload.

### ON DELETE referential actions on edge constraints
Cascading actions on an edge constraint let users define the acations that the database engine takes when a user deletes the node(s), which the given edge connects. The following referential actions can be defined:  
*NO ACTION*   
The database engine raises an error when you try to delete a node that has connecting edge(s).  

*CASCADE*   
When a node is delete from the database, connecting edge(s) are deleted.  

## Working with edge constraints

You can define a edge constraint in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]. An edge constraint can be defined on a graph edge table only. To create, delete, or modify an edge constraint, you must have **ALTER** permission on the table.

### Create edge constraints

The following examples show you how to create an edge constraints on new or existing tables

#### To create an edge constraint on a new edge table

The following example creates an edge constraint on the **bought** edge table.

```sql
-- CREATE node and edge tables
CREATE TABLE Customer
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      ,CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   )
AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE Product
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      ,ProductName VARCHAR(100)
   )
AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE bought
   (
      PurchaseCount INT
         ,CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT CONNECTION (Customer TO Product) ON DELETE NO ACTION
   )
   AS EDGE;
   ```

#### Defining referential actions on a new edge table 

The following example creates an edge constraint on the **bought** edge table and defines ON DELETE CASCADE referential action. 

```sql
-- CREATE node and edge tables
CREATE TABLE Customer
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      ,CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   )
AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE Product
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      ,ProductName VARCHAR(100)
   )
AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE bought
   (
      PurchaseCount INT
         ,CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT CONNECTION (Customer TO Product) ON DELETE CASCADE
   )
   AS EDGE;
   ```

#### To add edge constraint to an existing edge table

The following example uses ALTER TABLE to add an edge constraint to the **bought** edge table.

```sql
-- CREATE node and edge tables
CREATE TABLE Customer
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      , CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
CREATE TABLE Product
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , ProductName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE bought
   (
      PurchaseCount INT
   )
   AS EDGE;
GO
ALTER TABLE bought ADD CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT1 CONNECTION (Customer TO Product);
```  

#### Create a new edge constraint on existing edge table, with additional edge constraint clauses

The following example uses the `ALTER TABLE` command to add a new edge constraint with additional edge constraint clauses on the **bought** edge table.
  
```sql
-- CREATE node and edge tables
CREATE TABLE Customer
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE Supplier
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , SupplierName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE Product
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , ProductName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE bought
   (
      PurchaseCount INT
      , CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT CONNECTION (Customer TO Product)
   )
   AS EDGE;
-- Drop the existing edge constraint first and then create a new one.
ALTER TABLE bought DROP CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT;
GO
-- User ALTER TABLE to create a new edge constraint.
ALTER TABLE bought ADD CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT1 CONNECTION (Customer TO Product, Supplier TO Product);
```  

In the preceding example, there are two edge constraint clauses in *EC_BOUGHT1* constraint, one that connects **Customer** to **Product** and other connects **Supplier** to **Product**. Both these clauses are applied in disjunction. That is, a given edge has to satisfy either of these two clauses to be allowed in the edge table.

#### Creating a new edge constraint on existing edge table, with new edge constraint clause

The following example uses the `ALTER TABLE` command to add a new edge constraint with a new edge constraint clause on the **bought** edge table.
  
 ```sql
-- CREATE node and edge tables
CREATE TABLE Customer
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE Supplier
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , SupplierName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE Product
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , ProductName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE bought
   (
      PurchaseCount INT,
         CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT CONNECTION (Customer TO Product)
   )
   AS EDGE;
GO
ALTER TABLE bought ADD CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT1 CONNECTION (Supplier TO Product);
 ```  

In the preceding example, we created two separate edge constraints on the **bought** edge table, *EC_BOUGHT* and *EC_BOUGHT1*. Both these edge constraints have different edge constraint clauses. If an edge table has more than one edge constraint on it, a given edge has to satisfy **ALL** edge constraints to be allowed in the edge table. Since no edge will be able to satisfy both *EC_BOUGHT* and *EC_BOUGHT1* here, the **bought** edge table must remain empty.

For inserts to succeed in this edge table, either one of the edge constraint must be dropped, or both of them must be dropped and a new edge constraint should be created which has both edge constraint clauses in it.

```sql
-- Drop the existing edge constraint first and then create a new one.
ALTER TABLE bought DROP CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT;
GO
ALTER TABLE bought DROP CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT1;
GO
ALTER TABLE bought ADD CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT_NEW CONNECTION (Customer TO Product, Supplier TO Product);
GO
```  

For a given edge to be allowed in the **bought** edge, it has to satisfy either of the edge constraint clauses in *EC_BOUGHT_NEW* constraint. Hence any edge that is trying to connect valid **Customer** to **Product** or **Supplier** to **Product** nodes, will be allowed.

### Delete edge constraints

The following example first identifies the name of the edge constraint and then deletes the constraint.  
  
```sql
-- CREATE node and edge tables
CREATE TABLE Customer
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE Product
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , ProductName VARCHAR(100)
   ) AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE bought
   (
      PurchaseCount INT
      , CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT CONNECTION (Customer TO Product)
    )
    AS EDGE;
GO
-- Return the name of edge constraint.
SELECT name  
   FROM sys.edge_constraints  
   WHERE type = 'EC' AND parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID('bought');  
GO  
-- Delete the primary key constraint.  
ALTER TABLE bought
DROP CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT;
```  

### Modify edge constraints

To modify an edge constraint using Transact-SQL, you must first delete the existing edge constraint and then re-create it with the new definition.


### View edge constraints

[!INCLUDE[ssCatViewPerm](../../includes/sscatviewperm-md.md)] For more information, see [Metadata Visibility Configuration](../../relational-databases/security/metadata-visibility-configuration.md).

The example returns all edge constraints and their properties for the edge table `bought` in the tempdb database.  

```sql
-- CREATE node and edge tables
CREATE TABLE Customer
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
GO
CREATE TABLE Supplier
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , SupplierName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;
   GO
CREATE TABLE Product
   (
      ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
      , ProductName VARCHAR(100)
   )
   AS NODE;

-- CREATE edge table with edge constraints.
CREATE TABLE bought
   (
      PurchaseCount INT
      , CONSTRAINT EC_BOUGHT CONNECTION (Customer TO Product, Supplier TO Product)
   )
   AS EDGE;

-- Query sys.edge_constraints and sys.edge_constraint_clauses to view
-- edge constraint properties.
SELECT
   EC.name AS edge_constraint_name
   , OBJECT_NAME(EC.parent_object_id) AS edge_table_name
   , OBJECT_NAME(ECC.from_object_id) AS from_node_table_name
   , OBJECT_NAME(ECC.to_object_id) AS to_node_table_name
   , is_disabled
   , is_not_trusted
FROM sys.edge_constraints EC
   INNER JOIN sys.edge_constraint_clauses ECC
   ON EC.object_id = ECC.object_id
WHERE EC.parent_object_id = object_id('bought');
```
