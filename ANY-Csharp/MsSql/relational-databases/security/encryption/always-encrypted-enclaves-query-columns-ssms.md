# Query columns using Always Encrypted with secure enclaves with SSMS
[!INCLUDE [tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-winonly](../../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-winonly.md)]

This article describes how to use SQL Server Management Studio to issue queries that use a server-side secure enclave for [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](always-encrypted-enclaves.md), including:
- Queries that trigger in-place cryptographic operations.
- Queries triggering rich computations, including range comparisons or pattern matching operations on columns encrypted with enclave-enabled keys.
- Queries that create or update indexes on encrypted columns using randomized encryption and enclave-enabled keys.  

To use SSMS to run queries on encrypted columns using a secure enclave, follow the instructions in [Query columns using Always Encrypted with SQL Server Management Studio](always-encrypted-query-columns-ssms.md). Here are a few things that are specific to enclaves you should be aware of:

- You need SSMS version 18.3 or higher.
- Make sure you are running queries in a query window utilizing a secure enclave from a connection that has Always Encrypted and enclave computations enabled. For detailed instructions, see [Tutorial: Getting started with Always Encrypted with secure enclaves using SSMS](../tutorial-getting-started-with-always-encrypted-enclaves.md) and [Enabling and disabling Always Encrypted for a database connection ](always-encrypted-query-columns-ssms.md#en-dis).
