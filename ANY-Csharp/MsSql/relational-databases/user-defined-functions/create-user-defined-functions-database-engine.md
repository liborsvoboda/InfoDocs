# Create User-defined Functions (Database Engine)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]
  This topic describes how to create a user-defined function (UDF) in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)].  
  
##  <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a> Before You Begin  
  
###  <a name="Restrictions"></a> Limitations and restrictions  
  
-   User-defined functions cannot be used to perform actions that modify the database state.  
  
-   User-defined functions cannot contain an `OUTPUT INTO` clause that has a table as its target.  
  
-   User-defined functions can not return multiple result sets. Use a stored procedure if you need to return multiple result sets.  
  
-   Error handling is restricted in a user-defined function. A UDF does not support `TRY...CATCH`, `@ERROR` or `RAISERROR`.  
  
-   User-defined functions cannot call a stored procedure, but can call an extended stored procedure.  
  
-   User-defined functions cannot make use of dynamic SQL or temp tables. Table variables are allowed.  
  
-   `SET` statements are not allowed in a user-defined function.  
  
-   The `FOR XML` clause is not allowed.  
  
-   User-defined functions can be nested; that is, one user-defined function can call another. The nesting level is incremented when the called function starts execution, and decremented when the called function finishes execution. User-defined functions can be nested up to 32 levels. Exceeding the maximum levels of nesting causes the whole calling function chain to fail. Any reference to managed code from a Transact-SQL user-defined function counts as one level against the 32-level nesting limit. Methods invoked from within managed code do not count against this limit.  
  
-   The following Service Broker statements **cannot be included** in the definition of a [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)]  user-defined function:  
  
    -   `BEGIN DIALOG CONVERSATION`  
  
    -   `END CONVERSATION`  
  
    -   `GET CONVERSATION GROUP`  
  
    -   `MOVE CONVERSATION`  
  
    -   `RECEIVE`  
  
    -   `SEND`  
  
###  <a name="Security"></a> Permissions 

Requires `CREATE FUNCTION` permission in the database and `ALTER` permission on the schema in which the function is being created. If the function specifies a user-defined type, requires `EXECUTE` permission on the type.  
  
##  <a name="Scalar"></a> Scalar Functions  
 The following example creates a multi-statement **scalar function (scalar UDF)** in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database. The function takes one input value, a `ProductID`, and returns a single data value, the aggregated quantity of the specified product in inventory.  
  
```sql  
IF OBJECT_ID (N'dbo.ufnGetInventoryStock', N'FN') IS NOT NULL  
    DROP FUNCTION ufnGetInventoryStock;  
GO  
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.ufnGetInventoryStock(@ProductID int)  
RETURNS int   
AS   
-- Returns the stock level for the product.  
BEGIN  
    DECLARE @ret int;  
    SELECT @ret = SUM(p.Quantity)   
    FROM Production.ProductInventory p   
    WHERE p.ProductID = @ProductID   
        AND p.LocationID = '6';  
     IF (@ret IS NULL)   
        SET @ret = 0;  
    RETURN @ret;  
END; 
```  
  
 The following example uses the `ufnGetInventoryStock` function to return the current inventory quantity for products that have a `ProductModelID` between 75 and 80.  
  
```sql  
SELECT ProductModelID, Name, dbo.ufnGetInventoryStock(ProductID)AS CurrentSupply  
FROM Production.Product  
WHERE ProductModelID BETWEEN 75 and 80;  
```  

> [!NOTE]  
> For more information and examples of scalar functions, see [CREATE FUNCTION &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-function-transact-sql.md). 

##  <a name="TVF"></a> Table-Valued Functions  
The following example creates an **inline table-valued function (TVF)** in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database. The function takes one input parameter, a customer (store) ID, and returns the columns `ProductID`, `Name`, and the aggregate of year-to-date sales as `YTD Total` for each product sold to the store.  
  
```sql  
IF OBJECT_ID (N'Sales.ufn_SalesByStore', N'IF') IS NOT NULL  
    DROP FUNCTION Sales.ufn_SalesByStore;  
GO  
CREATE FUNCTION Sales.ufn_SalesByStore (@storeid int)  
RETURNS TABLE  
AS  
RETURN   
(  
    SELECT P.ProductID, P.Name, SUM(SD.LineTotal) AS 'Total'  
    FROM Production.Product AS P   
    JOIN Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS SD ON SD.ProductID = P.ProductID  
    JOIN Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SH ON SH.SalesOrderID = SD.SalesOrderID  
    JOIN Sales.Customer AS C ON SH.CustomerID = C.CustomerID  
    WHERE C.StoreID = @storeid  
    GROUP BY P.ProductID, P.Name  
);  
```  
  
The following example invokes the function and specifies customer ID 602.  
  
```sql  
SELECT * FROM Sales.ufn_SalesByStore (602);  
```  
  
The following example creates a **multi-statement table-valued function (MSTVF)** in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBnormal](../../includes/sssampledbnormal-md.md)] database. The function takes a single input parameter, an `EmployeeID` and returns a list of all the employees who report to the specified employee directly or indirectly. The function is then invoked specifying employee ID 109.  
  
```sql  
IF OBJECT_ID (N'dbo.ufn_FindReports', N'TF') IS NOT NULL  
    DROP FUNCTION dbo.ufn_FindReports;  
GO  
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.ufn_FindReports (@InEmpID INTEGER)  
RETURNS @retFindReports TABLE   
(  
    EmployeeID int primary key NOT NULL,  
    FirstName nvarchar(255) NOT NULL,  
    LastName nvarchar(255) NOT NULL,  
    JobTitle nvarchar(50) NOT NULL,  
    RecursionLevel int NOT NULL  
)  
--Returns a result set that lists all the employees who report to the   
--specific employee directly or indirectly.*/  
AS  
BEGIN  
WITH EMP_cte(EmployeeID, OrganizationNode, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, RecursionLevel) -- CTE name and columns  
    AS (  
        SELECT e.BusinessEntityID, e.OrganizationNode, p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle, 0 -- Get the initial list of Employees for Manager n  
        FROM HumanResources.Employee e   
INNER JOIN Person.Person p   
ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID  
        WHERE e.BusinessEntityID = @InEmpID  
        UNION ALL  
        SELECT e.BusinessEntityID, e.OrganizationNode, p.FirstName, p.LastName, e.JobTitle, RecursionLevel + 1 -- Join recursive member to anchor  
        FROM HumanResources.Employee e   
            INNER JOIN EMP_cte  
            ON e.OrganizationNode.GetAncestor(1) = EMP_cte.OrganizationNode  
INNER JOIN Person.Person p   
ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID  
        )  
-- copy the required columns to the result of the function   
   INSERT @retFindReports  
   SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, RecursionLevel  
   FROM EMP_cte   
   RETURN  
END;  
GO  
```  
  
The following example invokes the function and specifies employee ID 1.  
  
```sql  
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, JobTitle, RecursionLevel  
FROM dbo.ufn_FindReports(1);  
```  

> [!NOTE]  
> For more information and examples of inline table-valued functions (inline TVFs) and multi-statement table-valued functions (MSTVFs), see [CREATE FUNCTION &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../t-sql/statements/create-function-transact-sql.md). 

## Best Practices  
If a user-defined function (UDF) is not created with the `SCHEMABINDING` clause, changes that are made to underlying objects can affect the definition of the function and produce unexpected results when it is invoked. We recommend that you implement one of the following methods to ensure that the function does not become outdated because of changes to its underlying objects:  
  
-   Specify the `WITH SCHEMABINDING` clause when you are creating the UDF. This ensures that the objects referenced in the function definition cannot be modified unless the function is also modified.  
  
-   Execute the [sp_refreshsqlmodule](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-refreshsqlmodule-transact-sql.md) stored procedure after modifying any object that is specified in the definition of the UDF.  

If creating a UDF that does not access data, specify the `SCHEMABINDING` option. This will prevent the query optimizer from generating unnecessary spool operators for query plans involving these UDFs. For more information on spools, see [Showplan Logical and Physical Operators Reference](../../relational-databases/showplan-logical-and-physical-operators-reference.md). For more information on creating a schema bound function, see [Schema-bound functions](../../relational-databases/user-defined-functions/user-defined-functions.md#SchemaBound).

Joining to an MSTVF in a `FROM` clause is possible, but can result in poor performance. [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is unable to use all the optimized techniques on some statements that can be included in a MSTVF, resulting in a suboptimal query plan. To obtain the best possible performance, whenever possible use joins between base tables instead of functions.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> MSTVFs have a fixed cardinality guess of 100 starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)], and 1 for earlier [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] versions.    
> Starting with [!INCLUDE[ssSQL17](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)], optimizing an execution plan that uses MSTVFs can leverage interleaved execution, which results in using actual cardinality instead of the above heuristics.     
> For more information, see [Interleaved execution for multi-statement table valued functions](../../relational-databases/performance/intelligent-query-processing.md#interleaved-execution-for-mstvfs).

> [!NOTE]  
> ANSI_WARNINGS is not honored when you pass parameters in a stored procedure, user-defined function, or when you declare and set variables in a batch statement. For example, if a variable is defined as **char(3)**, and then set to a value larger than three characters, the data is truncated to the defined size and the `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement succeeds.
