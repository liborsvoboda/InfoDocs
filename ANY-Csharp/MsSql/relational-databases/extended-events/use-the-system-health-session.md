# Use the system_health Session

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md](../../includes/appliesto-ss-asdb-xxxx-xxx-md.md)]

The system_health session is an Extended Events session that is included by default with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. This session starts automatically when the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../../includes/ssdenoversion-md.md)] starts, and runs without any noticeable performance effects. The session collects system data that you can use to help troubleshoot performance issues in the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../../includes/ssde-md.md)]. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you do not stop, alter, or delete the system_health session. Any changes made to the system_health session settings may be overwritten by a future product update.
  
The session collects information that includes the following:  
  
-   The *sql_text* and *session_id* for any sessions that encounter an error that has a severity >= 20.  
  
-   The *sql_text* and *session_id* for any sessions that encounter a memory-related error. The errors include 17803, 701, 802, 8645, 8651, 8657 and 8902.  
  
-   A record of any non-yielding scheduler problems. These appear in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] error log as error 17883.  
  
-   Any deadlocks that are detected, including the deadlock graph.  
  
-   The *callstack*, *sql_text*, and *session_id* for any sessions that have waited on latches (or other interesting resources) for > 15 seconds.  
  
-   The *callstack*, *sql_text*, and *session_id* for any sessions that have waited on locks for > 30 seconds.  
  
-   The *callstack*, *sql_text*, and *session_id* for any sessions that have waited for a long time for preemptive waits. The duration varies by wait type. A preemptive wait is where [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] is waiting for external API calls.  
  
-   The *callstack* and *session_id* for CLR allocation and virtual allocation failures.  
  
-   The ring buffer events for the memory broker, scheduler monitor, memory node OOM, security, and connectivity.  
  
-   System component results from `sp_server_diagnostics`.  
  
-   Instance health collected by *scheduler_monitor_system_health_ring_buffer_recorded*.  
  
-   CLR Allocation failures.  
  
-   Connectivity errors using *connectivity_ring_buffer_recorded*.  
  
-   Security errors using *security_error_ring_buffer_recorded*.  

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on deadlocks, see [deadlocking in the Transaction Locking and Row Versioning Guide](../../relational-databases/sql-server-transaction-locking-and-row-versioning-guide.md#deadlocks).   
> For more information on SQL error messages, see [Database Engine Errors](../../relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors.md).

## Viewing the Session Data  
The session uses the ring buffer target and event file target to store the data. The event file target is configured with a maximum size of 5 MB and a file retention policy of 4 files. 

To view the session data from the ring buffer target with the Extended Events user interface available in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], see [Advanced Viewing of Target Data from Extended Events in SQL Server - Watch live data](../../relational-databases/extended-events/advanced-viewing-of-target-data-from-extended-events-in-sql-server.md#b3-watch-live-data).

To view the session data from the ring buffer target with [!INCLUDE[tsql](../../includes/tsql-md.md)], use the following query:  
  
```sql  
SELECT CAST(xet.target_data as xml) 
FROM sys.dm_xe_session_targets xet  
JOIN sys.dm_xe_sessions xe ON (xe.address = xet.event_session_address)  
WHERE xe.name = 'system_health'  
```  
  
To view the session data from the event file, use the Extended Events user interface available in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. For more information, see [Advanced Viewing of Target Data from Extended Events in SQL Server](../../relational-databases/extended-events/advanced-viewing-of-target-data-from-extended-events-in-sql-server.md).
  
## Restoring the system_health Session  
If you delete the system_health session, you can restore it by executing the **u_tables.sql** file in Query Editor. This file is located in the following folder, where **C:** represents the drive where you installed the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] program files, and **MSSQL1x** the major version of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]:  
  
 `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL1x.\<*instanceid*>\MSSQL\Install`  
  
Be aware that after you restore the session, you must start the session by using the `ALTER EVENT SESSION` statement or by using the **Extended Events** node in Object Explorer. Otherwise, the session starts automatically the next time that you restart the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] service.
