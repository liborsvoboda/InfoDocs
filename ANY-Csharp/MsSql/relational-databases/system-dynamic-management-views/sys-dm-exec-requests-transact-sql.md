## Remarks 
To execute code that is outside [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] (for example, extended stored procedures and distributed queries), a thread has to execute outside the control of the non-preemptive scheduler. To do this, a worker switches to preemptive mode. Time values returned by this dynamic management view do not include time spent in preemptive mode.

When executing parallel requests in [row mode](../../relational-databases/query-processing-architecture-guide.md#row-mode-execution), [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] assigns a worker thread to coordinate the worker threads responsible for completing tasks assigned to them. In this DMV only the coordinator thread is visible for the request. The columns **reads**, **writes**, **logical_reads**, and **row_count** are **not updated** for the coordinator thread. The columns **wait_type**, **wait_time**, **last_wait_type**, **wait_resource**, and **granted_query_memory** are **only updated** for the coordinator thread. For more information, see the [Thread and Task Architecture Guide](../../relational-databases/thread-and-task-architecture-guide.md).

## Permissions
If the user has `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission on the server, the user will see all executing sessions on the instance of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]; otherwise, the user will see only the current session. `VIEW SERVER STATE` cannot be granted in Azure SQL Database so `sys.dm_exec_requests` is always limited to the current connection.
  
## Examples  
  
### A. Finding the query text for a running batch

 The following example queries `sys.dm_exec_requests` to find the interesting query and copy its `sql_handle` from the output.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_requests;  
GO  
```  

Then, to obtain the statement text, use the copied `sql_handle` with system function `sys.dm_exec_sql_text(sql_handle)`.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_sql_text(< copied sql_handle >);  
GO  
```

### B. Finding all locks that a running batch is holding

The following example queries **sys.dm_exec_requests** to find the interesting batch and copy its `transaction_id` from the output.

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_requests;  
GO
```

Then, to find lock information, use the copied `transaction_id` with the system function **sys.dm_tran_locks**.  

```sql
SELECT * FROM sys.dm_tran_locks
WHERE request_owner_type = N'TRANSACTION'
    AND request_owner_id = < copied transaction_id >;
GO  
```

### C. Finding all currently blocked requests

The following example queries **sys.dm_exec_requests** to find information about blocked requests.  

```sql
SELECT session_id ,status ,blocking_session_id  
    ,wait_type ,wait_time ,wait_resource
    ,transaction_id
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests
WHERE status = N'suspended';  
GO  
```  

### D. Ordering existing requests by CPU

```sql
SELECT 
   req.session_id
   , req.start_time
   , cpu_time 'cpu_time_ms'
   , object_name(st.objectid,st.dbid) 'ObjectName' 
   , substring
      (REPLACE
        (REPLACE
          (SUBSTRING
            (ST.text
            , (req.statement_start_offset/2) + 1
            , (
               (CASE statement_end_offset
                  WHEN -1
                  THEN DATALENGTH(ST.text)  
                  ELSE req.statement_end_offset
                  END
                    - req.statement_start_offset)/2) + 1)
       , CHAR(10), ' '), CHAR(13), ' '), 1, 512)  AS statement_text  
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests AS req  
   CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(req.sql_handle) as ST
   ORDER BY cpu_time desc;
GO
```
