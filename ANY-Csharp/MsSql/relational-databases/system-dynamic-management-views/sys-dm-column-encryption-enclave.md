# sys.dm_column_encryption_enclave (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE [tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-winonly](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ssver15-xxxx-xxxx-xxx-winonly.md)]

Returns performance counters for the secure enclave for Always Encrypted. For more information, see [Always Encrypted with secure enclaves](../security/encryption/always-encrypted-enclaves.md).

If the enclave is configured and has been correctly initialized after the last restart of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], the view contains exactly one row. If the enclave is not configured or it has not been correctly initialized, the view returns no rows.

|current_column_encryption_key_count|**int**|The count of column encryption keys the enclave currently holds.|  
|current_memory_size_kb|**bigint**|Enclave memory size in KB|  
|total_evicted_session_count|**bigint**|The total count of enclave sessions evicted since the last server restart.|
