# sys.dm_os_wait_stats (Transact-SQL)
[!INCLUDE[tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md](../../includes/tsql-appliesto-ss2008-all-md.md)]

Returns information about all the waits encountered by threads that executed. You can use this aggregated view to diagnose performance issues with [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] and also with specific queries and batches. [sys.dm_exec_session_wait_stats &#40;Transact-SQL&#41;](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-exec-session-wait-stats-transact-sql.md) provides similar information by session.

## Permissions

On [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion_md](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], requires `VIEW SERVER STATE` permission.   
On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS_md](../../includes/sssds-md.md)] Premium Tiers, requires the `VIEW DATABASE STATE` permission in the database. On [!INCLUDE[ssSDS_md](../../includes/sssds-md.md)] Standard and Basic Tiers, requires the  **Server admin** or an **Azure Active Directory admin** account.   

##  <a name="WaitTypes"></a> Types of Waits  
 **Resource waits** 
 Resource waits occur when a worker requests access to a resource that is not available because the resource is being used by some other worker or is not yet available. Examples of resource waits are locks, latches, network and disk I/O waits. Lock and latch waits are waits on synchronization objects  
  
**Queue waits**  
 Queue waits occur when a worker is idle, waiting for work to be assigned. Queue waits are most typically seen with system background tasks such as the deadlock monitor and deleted record cleanup tasks. These tasks will wait for work requests to be placed into a work queue. Queue waits may also periodically become active even if no new packets have been put on the queue.  
  
 **External waits**  
 External waits occur when a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] worker is waiting for an external event, such as an extended stored procedure call or a linked server query, to finish. When you diagnose blocking issues, remember that external waits do not always imply that the worker is idle, because the worker may actively be running some external code.  
  
 `sys.dm_os_wait_stats` shows the time for waits that have completed. This dynamic management view does not show current waits.  
  
 A [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] worker thread is not considered to be waiting if any of the following is true:  
  
-   A resource becomes available.  
  
-   A queue is nonempty.  
  
-   An external process finishes.  
  
 Although the thread is no longer waiting, the thread does not have to start running immediately. This is because such a thread is first put on the queue of runnable workers and must wait for a quantum to run on the scheduler.  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] the wait-time counters are **bigint** values and therefore are not as prone to counter rollover as the equivalent counters in earlier versions of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)].  
  
 Specific types of wait times during query execution can indicate bottlenecks or stall points within the query. Similarly, high wait times, or wait counts server wide can indicate bottlenecks or hot spots in interaction query interactions within the server instance. For example, lock waits indicate data contention by queries; page IO latch waits indicate slow IO response times; page latch update waits indicate incorrect file layout.  
  
 The contents of this dynamic management view can be reset by running the following command:  
  
```sql  
DBCC SQLPERF ('sys.dm_os_wait_stats', CLEAR);  
GO  
```  
  
This command resets all counters to 0.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> These statistics are not persisted across [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] restarts, and all data is cumulative since the last time the statistics were reset or the server was started.  
  
 The following table lists the wait types encountered by tasks.

|BROKER_CONNECTION_RECEIVE_TASK |Occurs when waiting for access to receive a message on a connection endpoint. Receive access to the endpoint is serialized.|

|BROKER_FORWARDER |Internal use only. <br /> **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL12](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)] and later.| 
|BROKER_INIT |Occurs when initializing Service Broker in each active database. This should occur infrequently.| 
|BROKER_MASTERSTART |Occurs when a task is waiting for the primary event handler of the Service Broker to start. This should occur very briefly.|

|BROKER_REGISTERALLENDPOINTS |Occurs during the initialization of a Service Broker connection endpoint. This should occur very briefly.| 
|BROKER_SERVICE |Occurs when the Service Broker destination list that is associated with a target service is updated or re-prioritized.| 
|BROKER_SHUTDOWN |Occurs when there is a planned shutdown of Service Broker. This should occur very briefly, if at all.| 
|BROKER_START |Internal use only. <br /> **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL15_md](../../includes/sssql15-md.md)] and later.| 
|BROKER_TASK_SHUTDOWN |Internal use only. <br /> **Applies to**: [!INCLUDE[ssSQL14](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)] and later.|

|BROKER_TO_FLUSH |Occurs when the Service Broker lazy flusher flushes the in-memory transmission objects to a work table.|

|BROKER_TRANSMITTER |Occurs when the Service Broker transmitter is waiting for work. Service Broker has a component known as the Transmitter which schedules messages from multiple dialogs to be sent across the wire over one or more connection endpoints. The transmitter has 2 dedicated threads for this purpose. This wait type is charged when these transmitter threads are waiting for dialog messages to be sent using the transport connections. High values of waiting_tasks_count for this wait type point to intermittent work for these transmitter threads and are not indications of any performance problem. If service broker is not used at all, waiting_tasks_count should be 2 (for the 2 transmitter threads) and wait_time_ms should be twice the duration since instance startup. See [Service broker wait stats](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sql_service_broker/2008/12/01/service-broker-wait-types).|

|DEADLOCK_ENUM_MUTEX |Occurs when the deadlock monitor and sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks try to make sure that SQL Server is not running multiple deadlock searches at the same time.| 
|DEADLOCK_TASK_SEARCH |Large waiting time on this resource indicates that the server is executing queries on top of sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks, and these queries are blocking deadlock monitor from running deadlock search. This wait type is used by deadlock monitor only. Queries on top of sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks use DEADLOCK_ENUM_MUTEX.|

|DTC_TMDOWN_REQUEST |Occurs in a MS DTC worker session when SQL Server receives notification that the MS DTC service is not available. First, the worker will wait for the MS DTC recovery process to start. Then, the worker waits to obtain the outcome of the distributed transaction that the worker is working on. This may continue until the connection with the MS DTC service has been reestablished.| 
|DTC_WAITFOR_OUTCOME |Occurs when recovery tasks wait for MS DTC to become active to enable the resolution of prepared transactions.|
