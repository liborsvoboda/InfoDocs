# Directory_GetDirectories

`Directory_GetDirectories` returns the names of the subdirectories (including their paths) that match the specified search pattern in the specified directory, and optionally searches subdirectories.

```csharp
Directory_GetDirectories (
	@path NVARCHAR (MAX),
	@searchPattern NVARCHAR (MAX)
	@searchOption
)
RETURNS TABLE ([Match] NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL)
```

## Parameters

 - **path**: The relative or absolute path to the directory to search. This string is not case-sensitive.
 - **searchPattern**: The search string to match against the names of files in path. This parameter can contain a combination of valid literal path and wildcard (* and ?) characters, but it doesn't support regular expressions.
 - **searchOption**: One of the enumeration values that specifies whether the search operation should include all subdirectories or only the current directory.

### SearchOption

|AllDirectories         | 1             | Includes the current directory and all its subdirectories in a search operation. This option includes reparse points such as mounted drives and symbolic links in the search. |
