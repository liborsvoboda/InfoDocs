# Directory_GetFiles

`Directory_GetFiles` returns the names of files (including their paths) that match the specified search pattern in the specified directory, using a value to determine whether to search subdirectories.

Directory_GetFiles (

	@searchPattern NVARCHAR (MAX)
	@searchOption
)
RETURNS TABLE ([Match] NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL)
```

## Parameters

 - **path**: The relative or absolute path to the directory to search. This string is not case-sensitive.
 - **searchPattern**: The search string to match against the names of files in path. This parameter can contain a combination of valid literal path and wildcard (* and ?) characters, but it doesn't support regular expressions.
