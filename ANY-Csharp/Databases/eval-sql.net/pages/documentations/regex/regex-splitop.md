# Regex_SplitOp

`Regex_SplitOp` splits an input string into an array of substrings at the positions defined by a regular expression pattern using the specified matching options.

```csharp
Regex_SplitOp (
    @input NVARCHAR (MAX),
    @pattern NVARCHAR (MAX),
    @options INT
    )
RETURNS TABLE (Match NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL)
```

## Parameters

  - **input**: The input string that contains the text to convert.
  - **pattern**: The regular expression pattern to match.
  - **options**: A bitwise combination of the enumeration values that provide options for matching.

### Options

An array of strings.

| Options               |Integer Value  | Descritpiton  |
|:----------------------|:--------------|:--------------|
|None                   | 0             | Specifies that no options are set. |
|IgnoreCase             | 1             | Specifies case-insensitive matching. |
|Multiline              | 2             | Multiline mode. Changes the meaning of ^ and $ so they match at the beginning and end, respectively, of any line, and not just the beginning and end of the entire string.|
|ExplicitCapture        | 4             | Specifies that the only valid captures are explicitly named or numbered groups of the form (?<name>…). This allows unnamed parentheses to act as noncapturing groups without the syntactic clumsiness of the expression (?:…).|
|Compiled               | 8             | Specifies that the regular expression is compiled to an assembly. This yields faster execution but increases startup time. |
|Singleline             | 16            | Specifies single-line mode. Changes the meaning of the dot (.) so it matches every character (instead of every character except \n).|
|IgnorePatternWhitespace| 32            | Eliminates unescaped whitespace from the pattern and enables comments marked with #. |
|RightToLeft            | 64            | Specifies that the search will be from right to left instead of from left to right. |
|ECMAScript             | 256           | Enables ECMAScript-compliant behavior for the expression. This value can be used only in conjunction with the `IgnoreCase`, `Multiline`, and `Compiled` values. The use of this value with any other values results in an exception.|
|CultureInvariant       | 512           | Specifies that cultural differences in language are ignored.  |

You can also use more than one option by specifying the sum of their integer values. For example, to specify `IgnoreCase` and `Multiline` options, use 3 integer value and pass it as 3rd parameter.

## Returns

Gets the captured substring from the input string.

## Example

```csharp
SELECT * FROM Regex_Split('plum--pear', '-', 1)
```

# Regex_SplitOp4k

It is equivalent to `Regex_SplitOp` except no NVARCHAR(MAX) parameters; it can be used when input data will never be over 4000 characters as this function offers better performance.

```csharp
Regex_SplitOp4k (
    @input NVARCHAR (4000),
    @pattern NVARCHAR (4000),
    @options INT
    )
RETURNS TABLE (Match NVARCHAR (MAX) NULL)
```

## Example

```csharp
SELECT * FROM Regex_Split4k('plum--pear', '-', 1)
```
