# Misc

Dapper is a feature-rich object-relational mapper (ORM) for the .NET framework. It has a simple attribute-based system for mapping data between a database and a .NET object, as well as support for asynchronous operations and [bulk insert](/bulk-operations/bulk-insert) and update operations. Its simplicity, speed, and flexibility make it a popular choice among developers looking for an efficient way to work with data in their .NET applications.

In this section, we will cover a few more topics:

   - [Buffered / Unbuffered](/misc/buffered-unbuffered)
   - [Temporary Table](/misc/temporary-table)
   - [Transaction](/misc/transaction)
