   :description: We walk through a bash script for setting up a WordPress
                 deployment on Ubuntu that's managed by NGINX Unit and uses
                 NGINX for web serving. The resulting WordPress deployment is
                 scriptable, supports Let’s Encrypt, and has production-ready
                 settings.

   :description: We explore two use cases for filesystem isolation in NGINX
                 Unit.  First, we stop attackers from accessing sensitive
                 information, by restricting a compromised app to its sandbox
                 directory.  Second, we toggle between sets of global
                 dependencies by defining them in separate filesystems.

   :description: NGINX Unit 1.18.0 introduces filesystem isolation, the 'target'
                 option to reduce redundancy in PHP app configuration, and URL
                 encoding.  It also includes features introduced in NGINX Unit
                 1.17.0: redirects, and fractional server weights for traffic
                 distribution in upstream groups.

   :description: We show how to build an application stack with NGINX Unit,
                 enabling automated deployment of production environments with
                 custom‑built language runtime versions, libraries, modules,
                 and extensions. The sample app is WordPress deployed in a
                 Docker container.

   :description: NGINX Unit 1.16.0 introduces two new features that are already
                 familiar to NGINX users.  First, it can load balance across a
                 group of upstream servers using the round-robin method.
                 Second, you can define what happens when a requested file can't
                 be served, similar to the NGINX 'try_files' directive.

   :description: Assembly language is popular in all kinds of system software
                 and we believe that web development can also benefit from the
                 advantages it provides.  Today we're pleased to add support for
                 assembly language to NGINX Unit. Web development in assembly
                 has never been so easy.

   :description: NGINX Unit 1.13.0 introduces reverse proxying, and version
                 1.14.0 adds address-based routing to the internal routing and
                 file-serving functionality from previous releases.  We combine
                 the new features in a complete configuration example for IP
                 address filtering and access management.
