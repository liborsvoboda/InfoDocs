   :description: Application isolation in NGINX Unit enables you to control
                 which types of system resources your apps share with NGINX Unit
                 and each other.  Running apps in isolated environments improves
                 security.  Get all the details on how it works, and what it
                 means for the future of NGINX Unit.

   :description: Timo has worked with PHP and Node.js for years, and now with
                 NGINX Unit he’s able to use the app server as a core part of
                 his applications and APIs. In this session, Timo explains how
                 to create, manage, and deploy powerful APIs with PHP and
                 Node.js on top of NGINX Unit. He shares some libraries he wrote
                 for controlling NGINX Unit from Node.js and PHP.

   :description: NGINX Unit is a key component in our modern platform spans from
                 code to customer: it's configured dynamically via API for no
                 app downtime; it can run apps written in multiple languages and
                 versions at the same time; its small footprint makes it ideal
                 for microservices and deployable on any infrastructure.
