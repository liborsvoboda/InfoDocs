   :description: NGINX Unit makes supporting HTTPS simple and completely
                 application-agnostic, because encryption is applied at the
                 level of the listener, not the application.  No need to dig
                 into language‑specific details!  In this blog we illustrate 
                 HTTPS configuration for a Spring Boot application.

   :description: NGINX Unit 1.23.0 and 1.24.0 introduce support for the SNI
                 extension to TLS, definition of OpenSSL configuration commands,
                 MIME filtering and path restrictions for static content, and
                 multiple Python scripts in one app.  Also, you no longer need
                 to modify Node.js apps to run them in Unit.

   :description: Dive deep into two Linux features that underlie containers
                 namespaces and cgroups.  They enable process isolation,
                 ensuring that multiple processes running on a system don't
                 interfere with one another.  Our NGINX Unit application server
                 also uses them for application isolation.
