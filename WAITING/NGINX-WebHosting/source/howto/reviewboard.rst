Review Board
############

To run the `Review Board
<https://www.reviewboard.org>`_ code review tool using Unit:

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_install_unit.rst

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_install_prereq.rst

   .. note::

      We'll use Unit as the web server, so you can skip the corresponding step.

#. Install the |app-link|_ and create a `site
   <https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/dev/admin/installation/creating-sites/>`_.
   Here, it's **/path/to/app/**; use a real path in your configuration:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ rb-site install :nxt_ph:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application directory; use a real path in your configuration>`

            * Welcome to the Review Board site installation wizard

                This will prepare a Review Board site installation in:

                /path/to/app

                We need to know a few things before we can prepare your site for
                installation. This will only take a few minutes.
                ...

#. Add the **.py** extension to the WSGI module's name to make it
   discoverable by Unit, for example:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ mv :nxt_ph:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application directory; use a real path in your configuration>`htdocs/reviewboard.wsgi   \
           :nxt_ph:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application directory; use a real path in your configuration>`htdocs/wsgi.py

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_change_ownership.rst

   Also, make sure the following directories are `writable
   <https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/dev/admin/installation/creating-sites/#changing-permissions>`_:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ chmod u+w :nxt_ph:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application directory; use a real path in your configuration>`htdocs/media/uploaded/

   .. code-block:: console

      $ chmod u+w :nxt_ph:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application directory; use a real path in your configuration>`data/

#. Next, :ref:`prepare <configuration-python>` the |app| configuration for Unit
   (use real values for **share** and **path**):

   .. code-block:: json

      {
          "listeners": {
              "*:80": {
                  "pass": "routes"

                          "/static/*",
                          "/errordocs/*"
                      ]
                  },

                  "action": {
                      ":nxt_hint:`share <Serves matching static files>`": ":nxt_ph:`/path/to/app/ <Path to the application directory; use a real path in your configuration>`htdocs$uri"
                  }
              },
              {
                  "action": {
                      "pass": "applications/rb"
