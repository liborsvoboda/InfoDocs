   For a more specific walkthrough that includes SSL setup and NGINX as a
   proxy, see our `blog post
   <https://www.nginx.com/blog/automating-installation-wordpress-with-nginx-unit-on-ubuntu/>`__.

To run the `WordPress <https://wordpress.org>`__ content management system
using Unit:

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_install_unit.rst

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_install_prereq.rst

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_install_app.rst

#. Update the **wp-config.php** `file
   <https://wordpress.org/support/article/editing-wp-config-php/>`_ with your
   database settings and other customizations.

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_change_ownership.rst

#. Next, :ref:`prepare <configuration-php>` the |app| configuration for Unit
   (use real values for **share** and **root**):

          },

              {

              }
          }
      }

   .. note::

      The difference between the **pass** targets is their usage of the
      **script** :ref:`setting <configuration-php>`:

      - The **direct** target runs the **.php** script from the URI or
        defaults to **index.php** if the URI omits it.

      - The **index** target specifies the **script** that Unit runs
        for *any* URIs the target receives.

#. .. include:: ../include/howto_upload_config.rst

   After a successful update, browse to http://localhost and `set up
   <https://wordpress.org/support/article/how-to-install-wordpress/#step-5-run-the-install-script>`_
   your |app| installation:

   .. image:: ../images/wordpress.png
      :width: 100%
      :alt: WordPress on Unit - Setup Screen

   .. note::

      The resulting URI scheme will affect your WordPress configuration; updates
      may require `extra steps
      <https://wordpress.org/support/article/changing-the-site-url/>`_.
