OK, so you've decided to give Unit a try with your web app of choice.  You may
be looking for ways to run it faster with less config overhead, streamlining
your technology stack, or simply be tech-curious.  In any case:

   * - Step
     - Things to do

   * - **Check the prerequisites**
     - #. Verify that Unit :ref:`supports <source-prereqs>` your
          platform and app language version.

       #. If possible, ensure the app can run beside Unit to rule out
          external issues.

   * - **Get Unit on the system**
     - #. Install Unit with the language modules you need.  Your options:

          - Official **.deb/.rpm** :ref:`packages
            <installation-precomp-pkgs>`

          - Docker :ref:`images <installation-docker>`

          - Third-party :ref:`packages <installation-community-repos>`

          - Source :ref:`build <source>`

       #. Configure and launch Unit on your system:

          - Our own and third-party packages :ref:`rely on
            <installation-precomp-startup>` :program:`systemctl` or
            :program:`service`.

          - Containerized Unit can be :doc:`run <docker>` with common
            :program:`docker` commands.

          - If none of the above applies, customize Unit's :ref:`startup
            <source-startup>` manually.

   * - **Prepare** |_| **the** |_| **app** |_| **for** |_| **Unit**
     - #. *(Only applies to :ref:`Go <configuration-go>`)* Patch
          your app to run on Unit.

       #. Choose :ref:`common <configuration-applications>` options such as
          app type, working directory, user/group.

       #. Add :ref:`language-specific <configuration-languages>`
          settings such as index, entry module, or executable.

   * - **Plug the app into Unit**
     - #. *(Optional)* Add Unit-wide :ref:`settings <configuration-stngs>` to
          your app's config to run it smoothly.

       #. :ref:`Upload <configuration-mgmt>` your config into Unit to spin up
          the app.

       #. *(Optional)* Set up a :ref:`route <configuration-routes>` to your app
          to benefit from internal routing.

       #. *(Optional)* Upload a :ref:`certificate bundle <configuration-ssl>`
          if you want to support SSL/TLS.

       #. Finally, set up a :ref:`listener <configuration-listeners>` to make
          your app publicly available.
